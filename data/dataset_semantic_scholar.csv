https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12060922,"Phenology-Based Mapping of an Alien Invasive Species Using Time Series of Multispectral Satellite Data: A Case-Study with Glossy Buckthorn in Qu√©bec, Canada","Glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus Mill.) is an alien species in Canada that is invading many forested areas. Glossy buckthorn has impacts on the biodiversity and productivity of invaded forests. Currently, we do not know much about the species‚Äô ecology and no thorough study of its distribution in temperate forests has been performed yet. As is often the case with invasive plant species, the phenology of glossy buckthorn differs from that of other indigenous plant species found in invaded communities. In the forests of eastern Canada, the main phenological difference is a delay in the shedding of glossy buckthorn leaves, which occurs later in the fall than for other indigenous tree species found in that region. Therefore, our objective was to use that phenological characteristic to map the spatial distribution of glossy buckthorn over a portion of southern Qu√©bec, Canada, using remote sensing-based approaches. We achieved this by applying a linear temporal unmixing model to a time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images to create a map of the probability of the occurrence of glossy buckthorn for the study area. The map resulting from the temporal unmixing model shows an agreement of 69% with field estimates of glossy buckthorn occurrence measured in 121 plots distributed over the study area. Glossy buckthorn mapping accuracy was limited by evergreen species and by the spectral and spatial resolution of the Landsat 8 OLI.",,,,,2020-03-13,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,NA,NA,Map,Frangula alnus,2015,,,,3200,,density (cover),,,,Remote Sensing,2020,,invasive species
https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.201216,Policy changes and physicians opting out from Medicare in Quebec: an interrupted time-series analysis,"BACKGROUND: In all Canadian provinces, physicians can decide to either bill the provincial public system (opt in) or work privately and bill patients directly (opt out). We hypothesized that 2 policy events were associated with an increase in physicians opting out in Quebec. METHODS: The 2 policy events of interest were the 2005 Supreme Court of Canada ruling on Chaoulli v. Quebec and a regulatory clampdown forbidding double billing that was implemented by Quebec‚Äôs government in 2017. We used interrupted time-series analyses of the Quebec government‚Äôs yearly list of physicians who chose to opt out from 1994 to 2019 to analyze the relation between these events and physician billing status. RESULTS: The number of family physicians who opted out increased from 9 in 1994 to 347 in 2019. Opting out increased after the Chaoulli ruling, and our analysis suggested that between 2005 and 2019, 284 more family physicians opted out than if pre-Chaoulli trends had continued. The number of specialist physicians who opted out rose from 23 in 1994 to 150 in 2019. Our analysis suggested that an additional 69 specialist physicians opted out after the 2017 clampdown on double billing than previous trends would have predicted. INTERPRETATION: We found that the number of physicians who opted out increased in Quebec, and increases after 2 policy actions suggest an association with these policy interventions. Opting out decisions are likely important inputs into decision-making by physicians, which, in turn may influence the provision of publicly funded health care.",,,,,2021-02-16,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,no biological,no,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-biological related.

https://doi.org/10.1111/ECOG.05253,Climate extreme variables generated using monthly time‚Äêseries data improve predicted distributions of plant species,"Extreme weather can have significant impacts on plant species demography; however, most studies have focused on responses to a single or small number of extreme events. Long-term patterns in climate extremes, and how they have shaped contemporary distributions, have rarely been considered or tested. BIOCLIM variables that are commonly used in correlative species distribution modelling studies cannot be used to quantify climate extremes, as they are generated using long-term averages and therefore do not describe year-to-year, temporal variability. We evaluated the response of 37 plant species to base climate (long-term means, equivalent to BIOCLIM variables), variability (standard deviations) and extremes of varying return intervals (defined using quantiles) based on historical observations. These variables were generated using fine-grain (approx. 250 m), time-series temperature and precipitation data for the hottest, coldest and driest months over 39 years. Extremes provided significant additive improvements in model performance compared to base climate alone and were more consistent than variability across all species. Models that included extremes frequently showed notably different mapped predictions relative to those using base climate alone, despite often small differences in statistical performance as measured as a summary across sites. These differences in spatial patterns were most pronounced at the predicted range margins, and reflect the influence of coastal proximity, continentality, topography and orographic barriers on climate extremes. Species occupying hotter and drier locations that are exposed to severe maximum temperature extremes were associated with better predictive performance when modelled using extremes. Understanding how plant species have historically responded to climate extremes may provide valuable insights into our understanding of contemporary distributions and help to make more accurate predictions under a changing climate.",,,,,2021-02-02,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Australia

https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3098817,Exploitation of Time Series Sentinel-2 Data and Different Machine Learning Algorithms for Detailed Tree Species Classification,"The classification of tree species through remote sensing data is of great significance to monitoring forest disturbances, biodiversity assessment, and carbon estimation. The dense time series and a wide swath of Sentinel-2 data provided the opportunity to map tree species accurately and in a timely manner over a large area. Many current studies have applied machine learning (ML) algorithms combined with Sentinel-2 images to classify tree species, but it is still unclear, which algorithm is more effective in the automotive extraction of tree species. In this study, five ML algorithms were compared to identify the composition of tree species with multitemporal Sentinel-2 images in the JianShe forest farm, Northeast China. Three major types of deep neural networks [Conv1D, AlexNet, and long short-term memory (LSTM)] were tested to classify Sentinel-2 time series, which represent three disparate but effective strategies to apply sequential data. The other two models are support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which are renowned for extensive adoption and high performance for various remote sensing applications. The results show that the overall accuracy of neural network models is better than that of SVM and RF. The Conv1D model had the highest classification accuracy (84.19%), followed by the LSTM model (81.52%), and the AlexNet model (76.02%). For non-neural network models, RF's classification accuracy (79.04%) is higher than that of SVM (72.79%), but lower than that of Conv1D and LSTM. Therefore, the deep neural networks combined with multitemporal Sentinel-2 images can efficiently improve the accuracy of tree species classification.",,,,,2021,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,China
https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13142716,How Spatial Resolution Affects Forest Phenology and Tree-Species Classification Based on Satellite and Up-Scaled Time-Series Images,"The distribution of forest tree species provides crucial data for regional forest management and ecological research. Although medium-high spatial resolution remote sensing images are widely used for dynamic monitoring of forest vegetation phenology and species identification, the use of multiresolution images for similar applications remains highly uncertain. Moreover, it is necessary to explore to what extent spectral variation is responsible for the discrepancies in the estimation of forest phenology and classification of various tree species when using up-scaled images. To clarify this situation, we studied the forest area in Harqin Banner in northeast China by using year-round multiple-resolution time-series images (at four spatial resolutions: 4, 10, 16, and 30 m) and eight phenological metrics of four deciduous forest tree species in 2018, to explore potential impacts of relevant results caused by various resolutions. We also investigated the effect of using up-scaled time-series images by comparing the corresponding results that use pixel-aggregation algorithms with the four spatial resolutions. The results indicate that both phenology and classification accuracy of the dominant forest tree species are markedly affected by the spatial resolution of time-series remote sensing data (p < 0.05): the spring phenology of four deciduous forest tree species first rises and then falls as the image resolution varies from 4 to 30 m; similarly, the accuracy of tree species classification increases as the image resolution varies from 4 to 10 m, and then decreases as the image resolution gradually falls to 30 m (p < 0.05). Therefore, there remains a profound discrepancy between the results obtained by up-scaled and actual remote sensing data at the given spatial resolutions (p < 0.05). The results also suggest that combining phenological metrics and time-series NDVI data can be applied to identify the regional dominant tree species across different spatial resolutions, which would help advance the use of multiscale time-series satellite data for forest resource management.",,,,,2021-07-10,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no, X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,China
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10841-021-00353-4,"Moth species richness and diversity decline in a 30-year time series in Norway, irrespective of species‚Äô latitudinal range extent and habitat","
 
 Insects are reported to be in decline around the globe, but long-term datasets are rare. The causes of these trends are elusive, with changes in land use and climate among the top candidates. Yet if species traits can predict rates of population change, this can help identify underlying mechanisms. If climate change is important, for example, high-latitude species may decline as temperate species expand. Land use changes, however, may impact species that rely on certain habitats.
 
 
 We present 30 years of moth captures (comprising 97,032 individuals of 808 species) from a site in southeast Norway to test for population trends that are correlated with species traits. We use time series analyses and joint species distribution models combined with local climate and habitat data.
 
 
 Species richness declined by 8.2% per decade and total abundance appeared to decline as well (‚àí9.4%, p = 0.14) but inter-annual variability was high. One-fifth of species declined, although 6% increased. Winter and summer weather were correlated with annual rates of abundance change for many species. Opposite to general expectation, many species responded negatively to higher summer and winter temperatures. Surprisingly, species‚Äô northern range limits and the habitat in which their food plants grew were not strong predictors of their time trends or their responses to climatic variation. Complex and indirect effects of both land use and climate change may play a role in these declines.
 
 
 Our results provide additional evidence for long-term declines in insect abundance. The multifaceted causes of population changes may limit the ability of species traits to reveal which species are most at risk.

https://doi.org/10.1093/OXFORDJOURNALS.MOLBEV.A004014,A comparative mitogenomic analysis of the potential adaptive value of Arctic charr mtDNA introgression in brook charr populations (Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill).,"Wild brook charr populations (Salvelinus fontinalis) completely introgressed with the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) of arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) are found in several lakes of northeastern Qu√©bec, Canada. Mitochondrial respiratory enzymes of these populations are thus encoded by their own nuclear DNA and by arctic charr mtDNA. In the present study we performed a comparative sequence analysis of the whole mitochondrial genome of both brook and arctic charr to identify the distribution of mutational differences across these two genomes. This analysis revealed 47 amino acid replacements, 45 of which were confined to subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase complex (Complex I), one in the cox3 gene (Complex IV), and one in the atp8 gene (Complex V). A cladistic approach performed with brook charr, arctic charr, and two other salmonid fishes (rainbow trout [Oncorhynchus mykiss] and Atlantic salmon [Salmo salar]) revealed that only five amino acid replacements were specific to the charr comparison and not shared with the other two salmonids. In addition, five amino acid substitutions localized in the nad2 and nad5 genes denoted negative scores according to the functional properties of amino acids and, therefore, could possibly have an impact on the structure and functional properties of these mitochondrial peptides. The comparison of both brook and arctic charr mtDNA with that of rainbow trout also revealed a relatively constant mutation rate for each specific gene among species, whereas the rate was quite different among genes. This pattern held for both synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide positions. These results, therefore, support the hypothesis of selective constraints acting on synonymous codon usage.",,,"DNA, Mitochondrial; Amino Acids; Salmonidae; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Amino Acid Substitution; Genome, Mitochondrial; CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE; Salvelinus; Surgical Replantation; Salmo salar; Fishes; Genome; NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone)",,1/11/2002,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,"Salvelinus fontinalis, Salvelinus alpinus",,,,,,,,,,,Molecular Biology and Evolution,2002,,(Relevance article : X)
https://doi.org/10.3390/F10040325,A Conceptual Model for Forest Naturalness Assessment and Application in Quebec‚Äôs Boreal Forest,"Research Highlights: To inform eco-designers in green building conception, we propose a conceptual model for the assessment of the impact of using wood on the quality of ecosystems. Background and Objectives: The proposed model allows the assessment of the quality of ecosystems at the landscape level based on the condition of the forest and the proportion of different practices to characterize precisely the forest management strategy. The evaluation provides a numerical index, which corresponds to a suitable format to inform decision-making support tools, such as life cycle analysis. Materials and Methods: Based on the concept of naturalness, the methodology considers five naturalness characteristics (landscape context, forest composition, structure, dead wood, and regeneration process) and relies on forest inventory maps and data. An area within the boreal black spruce-feathermoss ecological domain of Quebec (Canada) was used as a case study for the development of the methodology, designed to be easily exportable. Results: In 2012, the test area had a near-natural class (naturalness index NI = 0.717). Simulation of different management strategies over 70 years shows that, considering 17.9% of strict protected areas, the naturalness index would have lost one to two classes of naturalness (out of five classes), depending on the strategy applied for the regeneration (0.206 ‚â§ ŒîNI ‚â§ 0.413). Without the preservation of the protected areas, the management strategies would have further reduced the naturalness (0.274 ‚â§ ŒîNI ‚â§ 0.492). Apart from exotic species plantation, the most sensitive variables are the percentage of area in irregular, old, and closed forests at time zero and the percentage of area in closed forests, late successional species groups, and modified wetlands after 70 years. Conclusions: Despite the necessity of further model and parameter validation, the use of the index makes it possible to combine the effects of different forestry management strategies and practices into one alteration gradient.",,,Forests; Parameter validation; Map; The Forest; Picea; Wetlands; Decision Making; Population Parameter; Natural regeneration; Ecosystem; Numerical analysis; Gradient; Simulation,,11/4/2019,,2,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,Forests,2019,,

https://doi.org/10.1021/ES0010204,A stable-isotope approach to delineate geographical catchment areas of avian migration monitoring stations in North America.,"Migration monitoring stations (MMSs) were established to provide information on population trends of North American passerines. However, apart from inferring general origins of birds, there has been no way to delineate geographical catchment areas sampled by MMSs. The ability to resolve MMS catchment areas would greatly enhance our ability to link and constrain population declines to specific geographical areas and thereby focus conservation efforts. Here, we utilize stable-hydrogen (delta D) and carbon (delta 13C) isotope values of rectrices of fall hatch-year (HY) and spring adult after-second year (ASY) Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) moving through two MMSs in Canada to determine natal and molting catchment areas for those stations. Stable-carbon isotope signatures provided no information on geographical origins of birds. Conversely, delta D signatures provided good latitudinal geographical control, and this was also supported by analysis of feathers from two other species, Gray-cheeked Thrush (Catharus minimus) and Harris' Sparrow (Zonotrichia querula), also known to breed and molt in northern regions. The delta D values of fall HY birds moving through Delta Marsh MMSs in Manitoba were more negative than those moving through Long Point MMSs in southern Ontario, clearly indicating more northwesterly origins. However, based on delta D values alone, both MMSs sampled birds from broad catchment regions of the Canadian Boreal forest. The interpolated catchment area of the Delta MMS encompassed northwest Manitoba to northwestern Alberta. The interpolated catchment area of the Long Point MMS extended from north central Ontario and Quebec and into western Canada. The delta D values of birds moving northward in spring suggested that most ASY Swainson's Thrush molted at more southerly locations than their breeding sites. We show the stable-hydrogen isotope approach may be employed to significantly improve conventional observational techniques for avian population monitoring, and that MMSs provide a reliable means of associating population productivity with regional conservation issues.",,,Oral candidiasis; Breeding; National origin; Molting; Passeridae; Aves; Methyl Methanesulfonate; hatching; gamma-delta T-Cell Receptor; Isotopes,,1/5/2001,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Maritoba and Ontario

American beech (Fagus grandifolia), a traditionally less desired species, is now increasingly being included in wood supplies to sawmills in western Quebec, where forest managers hope this resource can be valued before the onset of significant mortality and wood degradation from the beech bark disease.

Results from both survey types revealed that the finishing colour was the most important factor affecting the decision of respondents, followed by species and price. American beech ranked third in species preferences, just above birch. Divulgating species names only affected (positively) the perception of respondents towards oak. It was concluded that American beech could be included in the current wood flooring market, probably among cheaper options such as birch.

,"Anthidium manicatum (L.) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) found on the island of Newfoundland, Canada.","The island of Newfoundland is North America‚Äôs most easterly landmass, and its depauperate insect fauna is most likely reflective of the island‚Äôs isolation and its harsh climatic conditions. Newfoundland‚Äôs bee fauna is not specious with around 50 species recorded on the island (Hicks 2009), considerably fewer than adjacent mainland areas of Canada (Sheffield et al. 2003; Sheffield et al. 2008). This note details the occurrence of the introduced bee, Anthidium manicatum (L.) in Newfoundland. The native range of Anthidium manicatum is throughout Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but because of unintentional introductions, it has become the world‚Äôs most widespread unmanaged bee species (Strange et al. 2011). The first record of its establishment in North America was in 1963 at Ithaca, New York (Jaycox 1967; Pechuman 1967). While the spread of the bee initially seemed slow, it is now known to occur throughout the eastern and central US (Miller et al. 2002; Tonietto and Ascher 2008), to Colorado and Idaho (Gibbs and Sheffield 2009) and in California (Zavortink and Shanks 2008). The first Canadian record occurred in southern Ontario in 1984 (Smith 1991) where it is now widespread (Romankova 2003). It also now occurs in southern Quebec (Payette 2001), Nova Scotia (Hoebeke and Wheeler 2005), and British Columbia (Gibbs and Sheffield 2009). Anthidium manicatum is easily recognized within the bee fauna of Newfoundland; it has a black body and bold yellow stripes on the metasoma and a rather robust body (Figure 1a). The male has distinctive lateral spines on the 6th abdominal segment and three spines on the terminal segment. Males aggressively defend their territory and use these abdominal spines to knock other bees out of the air, sometimes killing them (Pechuman 1967; Severinghaus et al. 1981). Anthidium manicatum is known as the wool-carder bee because it gathers trichomes from plants that have dense pubescence on their leaves (Figure 1b). The ‚Äúwool‚Äù collected is used to line its brood cells which are constructed in a variety of pre-existing cavities in wood and other substrates. The brood cells are provisioned with a mixture of pollen and nectar (M√ºller et al. 1996). An egg is laid on the provision and the bee larva feeds and develops from this provision. M√ºller et al. (1996) describe how these bees also collect glandular products from plant trichomes on the basitarsis of the front legs and include these products among the wool. They surmise that the addition of the plant secretions to the wool helps waterproof the brood cells and also prevents microbial growth. The carding of wool by this species of bee seems to be restricted to plants in the Lamiaceae (mint family) where the non-native Lamb‚Äôs Ears, Stachys byzantina K. Kock, is the common host. Nectar foraging by Anthidium manicatum occurs on many different plant species, within the Lamiaceae, Fabaceae and Scrophulariaceae (Payette 2001; Zavortink and Shanks 2008). However, other plants (e.g., Asteraceae) may be utilized to a lesser extent (Miller et al. 2002). Anthidium manicatum was collected for the first time by the author on the west coast of Newfoundland on 21 July 2011 in Corner Brook (48.951528oN: 57.93465oW); a female resting on the side of a house. An additional female was captured by the author on 3 August taking nectar from Trifolium pratense L. (Fabaceae) near the first site.

It is shown that: (i) the existing network of protected areas in Qu√©bec does a poor job of protecting these biodiversity surrogates; (ii) adding adjacent areas to this network will not be the optimal way of protecting these biodiversity surrogates; (iii) many of the areas that have highest priority are in southern Qu√©bec, which has a high human population density; (iv) because of (iii), designating parks may not be economically or sociologically feasible and more adaptive alternative conservation plans will have to be devised; (v) coastal areas, riparian habitats, and other wetlands should have high priority for protection but are currently very inadequately represented in the reserve network; (vi) there is some reason for concern about the clear-cut logging of boreal forests in northern Qu√©bec; and (vii) the islands, √éle d'Anticosti and the √éles-de-la-Madeleine, emerge as being of very significant conservation value and plans for the protection of areas on them should be an immediate goal for biodiversity conservation in Qu√©bec.",,,Forests; Population Density; Park (environment); Vii; Complementarity theory; Mangrove Swamps; Subgroup; Wetlands; Algorithm; Habitat; Linear algebra; Surrogates; Emoticon; Spaces,,1/9/2001,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,article,article,no,NA,no,743 species (flora and fauna),1974-1999,source publication text,25,no,1500000,source publication text,,,,H,Biodiversity and Conservation,,,Only a list of species names

,"Arrenodes minutus (Drury, 1770) (Coleoptera: Brentidae) discovered in the Maritime Provinces of Canada.","Brentidae are large, elongate weevils found under the bark of various dead and dying deciduous trees. Females excavate a hole with their rostrum into which they deposit their eggs. Larvae bore deep into the heartwood where they appear to feed on wood and fungal mycelia (Anderson and Kissinger 2002). In North America the family is represented by five species in five genera. Three of these are found in southern Florida, and one in southern Texas. Arrenodes minutus (Drury, 1770) ranges throughout the eastern United States, north to southern Ontario and Qu√©bec (McNamara 1991; Laplante et al. 1991; Anderson and Kissinger 2002). Colloquially known as the ‚Äúoak timberworm,‚Äù larvae of A. minutus are frequently found boring in oaks (Quercus spp.) and other hardwoods. Adults feed at sap flows on oaks. Males are territorial and aggressive with one another and guard females during egg laying (Buchanan 1960; Sanborne 1983). When Majka et al. (2007) surveyed the introduced Apionidae (pear-shaped weevils) and Brentidae (straight-snouted weevils) of the Maritime Provinces, they reported a specimen of Arrenodes minutus intercepted in Nova Scotia in wooden furniture imported from Indiana in the United States. Recently, specimens of A. minutus have been found in both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia (Figs. 1-2) that establish the presence of this species, and hence the family Brentidae, in the Maritime Provinces.

,ArticleExploration for platinum-group minerals in till: A new approach to the recovery,"The discovery of new mineral deposits contributes to the sustainable mineral industrial development, which is essential to satisfy global resource demands. The exploration for new mineral resources is challenging in Canada since its vast lands are mostly covered by a thick layer of Quaternary sediments that obscure bedrock geology. In the course of the recent decades, indicator minerals recovered from till heavy mineral concentrates have been effectively used to prospect for a broad range of mineral deposits including diamond, gold, and base metals. However, these methods traditionally focus on (visual) investigation of the 0.25‚Äì2.0 mm grain-size fraction of unconsolidated sediments, whilst our observations emphasize on higher abundance, or sometimes unique occurrence of precious metal (Au, Ag, and platinum-group elements) minerals in the finer-grained fractions (<0.25 mm). This study aims to present the advantages of applying a mineral detection routine initially developed for gold grains counting and characterization, to platinum-group minerals in < 50 Œºm till heavy mineral concentrates. This technique, which uses an automated scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer, can provide quantitative mineralogical and semi-quantitative chemical data of heavy minerals of interest, simultaneously. This work presents the mineralogical and chemical characteristics, the grain size distribution, and the surface textures of 2664 discrete platinum-group mineral grains recovered from the processing of 5194 glacial sediment samples collected from different zones in the Canadian Shield (mostly Quebec and Ontario provinces). Fifty-eight different platinum-group mineral species have been identified to date, among which sperrylite (PtAs2) is by far the most abundant (n = 1488; 55.86%). Textural and mineral-chemical data suggest that detrital platinum-group minerals in the studied samples have been derived, at least in part, from Au-rich ore systems.",,,,,2021,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,no biological,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Assessing the Effectiveness of Instream Structures for Restoring Salmonid Streams,"Stream restoration is a billion dollar industry in North America. Despite this expenditure there remain questions regarding the effectiveness of current techniques, such as instream structures. The objectives of this research were to assess the impact of instream structures on physical habitat in the Nicolet River (Quebec) and to analyze physical habitat and fish abundance data from a large number of restoration projects using meta-analysis. Results of intensive surveys of the Nicolet River suggest that the installation of weirs and deflectors resulted in a greater frequency of pools. These pools have significantly greater depths, lower velocities and larger sediment size than those without structures. Compilation of data from 211 stream restoration projects showed a significant increase in pool area, average depth, large woody debris and percent cover as well as a decrease in riffle area following the installation of instream structures. The physical changes observed in the Nicolet River resulted in improved trout habitat, as measured by applying habitat preference curves, but uneven stocking practices and fishing pressure confounded attempts to verify differences in trout density among pool types. The meta-analysis, however, showed a significant increase in salmonid density and biomass following the installation of structures, although the relationship with physical habitat variables is not strong. Large differences in density response were observed between species. This compilation highlights the potential of instream structures to create better habitat for and increase the abundance of salmonids, but the scarcity of long-term monitoring of the effectiveness of instream structures is problematic.",,,Salmonidae; Large; Compiler; Habitat; Circuit restoration,,2009,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No relevant data
https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11232745,Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Black Spruce Bud Phenology across Quebec Based on MODIS-NDVI Time Series and Field Observations,"Satellite remote sensing is a widely accessible tool to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in the bud phenology of evergreen species, which show limited seasonal changes in canopy greenness. However, there is a need for precise and compatible data to compare remote sensing time series with field observations. In this study, fortnightly MODIS-NDVI was fitted using double-logistic functions and calibrated using ordinal logit models with the sequential phases of bud phenology collected during 2015, 2017 and 2018 in a black spruce stand. Bud break and bud set were spatialized for the period 2009‚Äì2018 across 5000 stands in Quebec, Canada. The first phase of bud break and the last phase of bud set were observed in the field in mid-May and at the beginning of September, when NDVI was 80.5% and 92.2% of its maximum amplitude, respectively. The NDVI rate of change was estimated at 0.07 in spring and 0.04 in autumn. When spatialized on the black spruce stands, bud break was detected earlier in the southwestern regions (April‚ÄìMay), and later in the northeastern regions (mid to end of June). No clear trend was observed for bud set, with different patterns being detected among the years. Overall, the process bud break and bud set lasted 51 and 87 days, respectively. Our results demonstrate the potential of satellite remote sensing for providing reliable timings of bud phenological events using calibrated NDVI time series on wide regions that are remote or with limited access.",,,Sampling (signal processing); Time series; Design of experiments; Spatiotemporal pattern; Ordinal data; First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC; Linear algebra; Proxy server; Motorola Canopy,,22/11/2019,,1,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,"Map, site coordinates",black spruce,2015-2018,,,,800000,,,,,,Remote Sensing,2019,,(Relevance article : L)

All of these factors showed significant independent effects, but 60% of the variance remained unexplained. Site characteristics, however, did not show a significant relationship to stand mortality.

However, it remains controversial whether these reductions in diversity will affect energy flow and nutrient cycling. Diversity has two components: species richness, or the number of plant species in a given area, and species evenness, or how well distributed abundance or biomass is among species within a community. We experimentally varied species evenness and the identity of the dominant plant species in an old field of Quebec to test whether plant productivity would increase with increasing levels of evenness, and whether relationships would be invariant with respect to species identity. Total and belowground biomass increased linearly with increasing levels of evenness after one growing season. These relationships did not depend on the identity of the dominant species. Relationships between aboveground biomass and evenness varied and depended on the identity of...",,,Sampling (signal processing); Community; Gene Ontology Term Enrichment; Nutrient cycle; Fragmentation (computing); Ecosystem; Experiment; Space: Above and Beyond,,1/4/2000,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,site coordinates,>1,km,,,,,,,,,,Ecology,2000,,(Relevance article : L)
https://doi.org/10.1656/045.027.0416,Biophysical Features Determining Avian Use of Roadside Verges in Southern Qu√©bec's Suburban and Rural Landscapes,"Abstract - Habitat loss and degradation due to urbanization and intensification of agriculture are among the leading causes of the decline of biodiversity on Earth. Vegetated zones of rights-of-ways (the median zone and roadside verges) could, however, contribute to wildlife conservation where remaining natural habitats continue to rapidly disappear. The objective of this study is to identify biophysical features of the various maintenance units (green shoulders, embankments, ditches, and banks) of highway roadside verges (HRVs) in suburban and rural landscapes that influence avian abundance and richness. Results indicate that wider HRVs favor a greater use by birds, particularly when in association with an increase in the shrub cover in ditches and embankments. Since maximizing the contribution of the vegetated zones of the road network is now an important consideration in regional biodiversity conservation strategies in human-dominated landscapes, we recommend that embankments and banks should have a diversified plant structure and cover. Various changes to the conventional methods of the maintenance of vegetation along HRVs are therefore proposed, such as halting mowing for a period of 5 to 10 years to favor the succession of native plant species. Maximizing the contribution of HRV to bird conservation in suburban and rural landscapes will also have other environmental and social benefits.",,,,,8/12/2020,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,NA,CANT ACCESS,,,,,,,,,,,,BioOne,2000,,
https://doi.org/10.2307/1369707,Bird abundance and diversity along an urban-rural gradient : A comparative study between two cities on different continents,"We compared the avifauna in two cities, Quebec (Canada) and Rennes (France), in order to define general responses of wildlife in an urban ecosystem. These cities have a similar urban structure that permits investigation along an urbanization gradient from downtown to rural residential areas. However, they are in opposite temperate climate and imbedded in a forested and an agricultural landscape, respectively. Plots ranging from 10 to 20 ha were surveyed in winter and spring by recording all birds seen or heard. Most plots could be located along a gradient according to proportions of vegetated open space. Both the Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indices of diversity indicated a pattern of increasing diversity from most to least urbanized areas in spring. Winter species diversity and richness was low in Quebec compared to Rennes, reflecting the much harsher winter conditions in Quebec. Breeding densities of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) and European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were quite similar in Quebec and Rennes, as were densities of European Blackbirds (Turdus merula) and its ecological equivalent in Quebec, the American Robin (Turdus migratorius). The type of surrounding landscape can not explain the variation of species numbers within the city. If we examine the urban environment as a new ecological system rather than a degraded environment, we can regroup birds in two major species groups: the omnivorous species adapted to the urban environment and its particular food resources such as garbage and the species that find, in the urban environment, resources which they normally exploit in their usual habitat.",,,Simpson's rule; density; Cooperative breeding; Sturnidae; Passeridae; Shannon (unit); Urban ecosystem; Aves; License; Gradient; Urbanization,,1/8/1998,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,administration unit,c.40 bird species,,,,,,,,,,,Ornithological Applications,1998,,(Relevance article : L)

One of the last intact forest landscapes south of the 50th parallel in Qu√©bec includes the Ya'nienhonhndeh territory, which has been the focus of a protected area project directed by the Huron-Wendat First Nation for more than ten years. To contribute to the characterization of its conservation value, we report the calicioids from the area. We identified 34 species in eight genera from 187 samples collected in old-growth stands of balsam fir, black spruce and yellow birch. Our four most remarkable discoveries are Chaenotheca nitidula Tibell (n = 11), Chaenothecopsis australis Tibell (n = 1), and C. tsugae Rikkinen (n = 2), which are reported for the first time from the province, as well as Sclerophora coniophaea (Norman) Mattsson & Middelb.

As a result of this inventory, the Ya'nienhonhndeh is now the second richest area known for calicioids in Qu√©bec, after Parc national de la Gasp√©sie.

https://doi.org/10.1002/ECS2.2022,Can sugar maple establish into the boreal forest? Insights from seedlings under various canopies in southern Quebec,"Understanding tree recruitment dynamics in various growth environments is essential for a better assessment of tree species‚Äô adaptive capacity to climate change. We investigated the microsite factors influencing survival, growth, and foliar nutrition of natural and planted sugar maple seedlings (Acer saccharum) along a gradient of tree species that reflect the change in composition from temperate hardwoods to boreal forests of eastern Canada. We specifically tested whether the increasing abundance of conifers in the forest and its modifications on soil properties negatively affects foliar nutrition of natural seedlings as well as the survival and growth of seedlings planted directly in the natural soil and in pots filled with enriched soil. Results of natural seedlings indicate that under conifer-dominated stands, lower soil pH, accelerated dissolution of some minerals, lower temperature and moisture, and higher levels of phenolic compounds have created microsites that are less suitable for sugar maple foliar nutrition and regeneration. These conditions were omnipresent under hemlock. The growth of seedlings planted in the natural soil was negatively impacted by the overall low soil quality under all forest types (as compared to seedlings planted in pots with enriched soil). However, survival and growth of the seedlings were not negatively affected by conifers, regardless of planting type, likely because of stored nutrients from the nursery. Also, lower survival was found under maple‚Äìbirch stands for seedlings planted both in the natural soil and in pots with enriched soil due to higher shading. This study has identified key microsite factors created by specific conifers that may impede or benefit the potential of sugar maple to maintain its current range or expand its range northward under climate change.",,,Climate Change; Forests; Maple; phenolics; Phenol formaldehyde resin; The Forest; Hemlock (editor); Coniferophyta; Impacted tooth; Minerals; Shading; Betula Genus; Seedlings; Gradient; Fill; Tsuga,,2018,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,site coordinates,11 tree species,,,,,,,,,,,Ecosphere,2018,,(Relevance article : L)
,"CAREX √óCAYOUETTEI (CYPERACEAE), A NEW INTERSECTIONAL SEDGE HYBRID FROM SOUTHERN QUEÃÅBEC, CANADA","A putative hybrid of Carex (Cyperaceae) was discovered in a swamp in the Montr√©al regi on (southern Qu√©bec, Canada). A survey of the surrounding vegetati on, numerical phenetic analysis, and use of proxies of plant sterility showed that the individuals w ere sterile intersectional hybrids between sects. Lupulinae and Vesicariae. We propose the name Carex √ócayouettei A. Bergeron, hybr. nov. for the hybrid combination C. comosa √ó C. lupulina. Several factors (reproduction time, habitat and natural range) support the assumption that the hybrid is likely more common than suggested by previous knowledge, but difficulties encountered in identification may have limited documentation. This finding strengthens the evidence that Lupulinae and Vesicariae are closely related. An unidentified sedge was discovered near a swamp during a su rvey of an urban forest in the metropolitan Montr√©al area. The plant did not resemble a ny known species of the region; we thus suspected that it was a natural hybrid. Initially, Carex lupulina and C. pseudocyperus seemed to be possible parents (authorities are given in Appendix 1), since both were found in the swamp near the unfamiliar sedge. Such a combination was nevertheless questi onable because intersectional hybrids between sects. Lupulinae Tuck. ex J. Carey and Vesicariae (Heuff.) J. Carey [combined with sect. Pseudocypereae (Tuck.) Christ sensu Ball & Reznicek 2002] are uncommon (Cayouette & Catling 1992). In addition, visual analysis of the characters was problematic, particularly in relation to size of vegetative organs, which did not appear intermediate. Although hybrid vigor exists among sedges, the intermediate state or presence of some characters mo re related to one of the parents is essential to the determination of legitimate intersectional hybrids such as C. lupulina √ó retrorsa Schwein. (Dudley 1886; Cayouette & Catling 1992). We therefore examined t h sedge vegetation around the unfamiliar plant more closely, and performed a phenetic an alysis involving several other putative parents to determine which ones were involved in the hybrid com bination. Study site The unidentified sedge was found at the Bois-de-Saraguay Na ture-Park (45¬∞ 30.9' N, 73¬∞ 44.5' W), southern Qu√©bec, Canada. This Park is one of t h best preserved urban forests on the Island of Montr√©al, not only because of restricted public access, but also because of its size (96 ha). This mature forest is characterized by a mosaic of mesic a nd hygric habitats with tree associations dominated by Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, and Tilia americana on well-drained soils, swamps dominated by Acer saccharinum, and Fraxinus pennsylvanica on poorly-drained soils (Domon et al. 1986). In an exhaustive floristic survey (152 pers on-days) carried out by our research team between June and August 2011, a total of ca. 389 taxa w ere recorded, which represents a high level of richness for the region. Sedges accounted for a pool of 32 species (Appendix 1). Several rare Qu√©bec plants are only present in this park (Bergeron & Pell erin 2011; Bergeron et al. 2013). Despite low levels of past anthropogenic disturbances in this urban cont ext, ca. 21% of florula is composed of naturalized and ephemeral plants. Bergeron and Pellerin: Carex √ócayouettei, intersectional hybrid 2 Fieldwork and laboratory During the plant survey of an open, flooded swamp on July 7, 2011, w e collected the putative sedge hybrid for the first time. On July 14, 2011, we returned to the site to note all sedge species present in the swamp and within radii of 10 and 5 meters of the put ative hybrid population. Macromorphological characters were measured in situ and ex situ on live specimens and those collected; the latter were then dried. Nine to twelve ra ndom measurements were taken for each character. In the laboratory, pollen grains were stai ned with cotton blue (lactophenol) to indicate defective cytoplasm. In order to collect the achenes, we examined the site closely a final time on October 16, 2011. Phenetic analysis After a summary examination of macromorphological measurements , we classified the putative hybrid as belonging to the group of ‚Äúbladder‚Äù and ‚Äúbottlebr ush‚Äù sedges (sensu Hipp 2008). The specimens bore long and inflated perigynia, which disti nguish the sect. Lupulinae and pistillate scales with scabrous awns characterizing, ter alia, the sect. Vesicariae. Furthermore, the broad vegetative blades on the putative hybrid could place it not far f rom the broadly construed sect. Paludosae (Heuff.) Christ (Ball & Reznicek 2002). For phenetic analysis, we first checked the sedge list for the Bois-de-Saraguay (Appendix 1) to select the putative parents among Carex sects. Lupulinae, Vesicariae, and Paludosae. We included species belonging to the three sections, with the exception of C. grayi (globular spikes) and C. pellita (pubescent perigynia), which have characters too distant f rom the putative hybrid. Second, we included five species forming hybrid combinations according to Cayouette and Catling (1992) and with documented occurrences in the Montr√©al region and souther n Qu√©bec (A. Bergeron, unpub. data; Brouillet et al., 2010+). Carex lupuliformis Sartwell ex Dewey was not selected due to its rarity nd remote populations well-researched in the context of the Pe ll rin‚Äôs team‚Äôs project, ‚ÄúRescuing false hop sedge‚Äù (Environment Canada 2014). Finally, we included thre e species exhibiting some ornamental qualities, unlisted for Qu√©bec but possibly pres ent due to escape from cultivation. In order of selection as described above, the 13 species are the following: C. intumescens, C. lacustris, C. lupulina, C. pseudocyperus, C. retrorsa, C. comosa Boott, C. hystericina Muhl. ex Willd., C. lurida Wahlenb., C. utriculata Boott, C. vesicaria L., C. acutiformis Ehrh., C. gigantea Rudge, and C. hyalinolepis Steud. Measurements of macromorphological characters related to the 13 possible parents were compiled from the literature (Gleason & Cronquist 1991; Hill 2006; Ball & Reznicek 2002; Jones 2010). Data analysis was performed by Principal Coordin ates Analysis (PCoA) with Caillez correction (Legendre & Legendre 2012, p. 493) on the mid-point of m in and max values of each character. The PCoAs were calculated on character tabl es rescaled in Gower‚Äôs dissimilarity matrix (Legendre & Legendre 2012, p. 278), and then multiplied with an F-ratio weighting (Adams 1972, 1982). With the min and max values of each character, an F-r tio (intergroup variance √∑ intragroup variance) was calculated from an ANOVA between the spec ies. Derived from the literature, these ranges of values establish the true boundaries of the specie , which guarantees the validity of the calculations even if the intragroup variance were computed on only two degrees of freedom. In fact, we also tried the PCoAs without weighting (Adams 1972, 1982), which did not alter our conclusions. However, the weighting with the F-ratios gave the greatest amount of explained variance on the first two PCoA axes, which justified the use of this procedure. Note also that these numerical methods are not statistical hypothesis tests. We used the weighted PC oAs to synthesize information and draw a conclusion based on decisions. All analyses were performed using the R language (R core team, 2013). Bergeron and Pellerin: Carex √ócayouettei, intersectional hybrid 3 Preliminary analysis Eighteen selected characters known to discriminate sedges within and between the three sections were used (Table 1) in a preliminary analysis whi ch aimed to reduce the number of putative parents to be examined in detail. By excluding the putative hy brid, we calculated F-ratios for weighting each of the 18 characters (Table 1). Ordination of the first two PCoA axes with the 14 taxa including the putative hybrid (80% of explained variance) made it possible to segregate sedge sections and identify species with characters too dista nt from the putative hybrid. All members of sect. Paludosae were discarded. We then calculated two other PCoAs that le d to the successive removal of species distantly related to the putative hybrid . The last preliminary PCoA was performed on seven taxa (94% of explained variance) and placed the putati ve hybrid approximately in the middle of the PCoA axis I, the Lupulinae being on one side and Pseudocypereae [incl. within sect. Vesicariae] on the other. Triplet analysis To show the intermediate state of the putative hybrid relati v to the characters of two sedge species, we only retained the six most likely parents ( Carex comosa, C. gigantea, C. hystericina, C. intumescens, C. lupulina, and C. pseudocyperus) found in preliminary analyses. For the final analyses, we included 23 characters to improve refinement o f the differences between taxa, and calculated new F-ratios (by excluding the putative hybrid) for weighting each of these characters (Table 1). By considering one species of sect. Lupulinae, the putative hybrid, and one species of sect. Pseudocypereae, we performed nine weighted PCoAs i.e., on all possib le combinations of triplets. Table 1.

A total of 64 species representing 30 genera was collected. Twenty-three genera and 47 species are new records for the Island of Newfoundland; eight additional species were identified to genus level only. For each species, the abundance in soil samples and distribution among microhabitats are described. The fauna of Newfoundland is about equivalent in species richness to that of Quebec and almost twice as rich as the recorded fauna of the Maritime Provinces. Few species are common to the three areas. However, this probably reflects the general paucity of knowledge of Canadian Collembola rather than indicating strong regional patterns in faunal composition.

Endogeic species were extracted from soil cores using Berlese-Tullgren funnels while epigeic species were collected using pit-light traps (Luminoc¬Æ). Comparisons of species presence, abundance, and dominance among sites and seasons were done using Sorensen's similarity coefficients and CANOCO. A total of 92 species from 7 families and 35 genera were identified. Species dominance and community structure differed according to humus types. Two groups of endogeic species were identified. The mor/mor-moder type group included Folsomia penicula, Hypogastrura (Ceratophysella) spp. Que., Micrisotoma achromata, Onychiurus (Protaphorura)? parvicornis, Onychiurus (Onychiurus) sp. A Que. And Onychiurus (Onychiurus) sp. B Que. The mull/mull-moder type group included Isotoma (Desoria) notabilis, Tullbergia (Tullbergia) silvicola, Tullbergia (Tullbergia) clavata , and Pseudosinella alba. Such clear humus type relationships were not found among the epigeic species, but important seasonal changes in community structures were found for these species. Spring species were Sminthurinus (Katiannina) macgillivrayi, Hypogastrura (Ceratophysella) maheuxi, Hypogastrura (Hypogastrura) sp. A Que. and Sminthurinus (Sminthurinus) latimaculosus. Tomocerus (Pogonognathellus) flavescens, Sminthurinus (Sminthurinus) henshawi , and Orchesella hexfasciata appeared in the summer samples while Dicyrtoma (Dicyrtoma) aurata was found only in fall samples where it was dominant in most sites along with either Sminthurides (Sminthurides) lepus or Sminthurinus (Sminthurinus) quadrimaculatus.

https://doi.org/10.1086/671900,Comparative Physiology and Relative Swimming Performance of Three Redhorse (Moxostoma spp.) Species: Associations with Fishway Passage Success*,"Our understanding of biological criteria to inform fish passage design is limited, partially due to the lack of understanding of biological motivators, cues, and constraints, as well as a lack of biological performance evaluations of structures once they are built. The Vianney-Legendre vertical slot fishway on the Richelieu River, Quebec, Canada, passes large numbers of migrating redhorse (Moxostoma spp.) upriver to spawning grounds each year. We evaluated the physiological capacity and relative swimming ability of three redhorse species (Moxostoma anisurum, Moxostoma carinatum, Moxostoma macrolepidotum; silver, river, and shorthead redhorse, respectively) to determine how these biotic factors relate to variation in fishway passage success and duration. Shorthead redhorse had higher maximum metabolic rates and were faster swimmers than silver and river redhorse at their species-specific peak migration temperatures. Blood lactate and glucose concentrations recovered more quickly for river redhorse than for silver and shorthead redhorse, and river redhorse placed second in terms of metabolic recovery and swim speed. Interestingly, fish sampled from the top of the fishway had nearly identical lactate, glucose, and pH values compared to control fish. Using passive integrated transponders in 2010 and 2012, we observed that passage success and duration were highly variable among redhorse species and were not consistent among years, suggesting that other factors such as water temperature and river flows may modulate passage success. Clearly, additional research is needed to understand how organismal performance, environmental conditions, and other factors (including abundance of conspecifics and other comigrants) interact with fishway features to dictate which fish will be successful and to inform research of future fishways. Our research suggests that there may be an opportunity for a rapid assessment approach where fish chased to exhaustion to determine maximal values of physiological disturbance are compared to fish sampled from the top of the fishway, which could reveal which species (or sizes of fish) are approaching or exceeding their physiological capacity during passage.",,,Moxostoma austrinum; Mental association; physiological aspects; Silver; Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Evaluation; Moxostoma cf. macrolepidotum PMH-2002; Glucose; Lactic acid; Flow,,23/9/2013,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,no,NA,site coordinates,"Moxostoma anisurum, Moxostoma carinatum, Moxostoma macrolepidotum",2012,source publication text,<1,no,0.5,no,presence only,,,,Physiological  and  Biochemical  Zoology,,,(Relevance article : X)

Detection of microcystin biosynthetic genes in water blooms of cyanobacteria is generally indicative of the presence of potentially toxic cyanobacterial strains. Although much effort has been devoted toward elucidating the microcystin biosynthesis mechanisms in many cyanobacteria genera, little is known about the impacts of co‚Äêoccurring cyanobacteria on cellular growth, mcy gene expression, or mcy gene copy distribution. The present study utilized conventional microscopy, qPCR assays, and enzyme‚Äêlinked immunosorbent assay to study how competition between microcystin‚Äêproducing Microcystis aeruginosa CPCC 299 and Planktothrix agardhii NIVA‚ÄêCYA 126 impacts mcyE gene expression, mcyE gene copies, and microcystin concentration under controlled laboratory conditions. Furthermore, analyses of environmental water samples from the Missisquoi Bay, Quebec, enabled us to determine how the various potential toxigenic cyanobacterial biomass proxies correlated with cellular microcystin concentrations in a freshwater lake. Results from our laboratory study indicated significant downregulation of mcyE gene expression in mixed cultures of M. aeruginosa plus P. agardhii on most sampling days in agreement with depressed growth recorded in the mixed cultures, suggesting that interaction between the two species probably resulted in suppressed growth and mcyE gene expression in the mixed cultures. Furthermore, although mcyE gene copies and McyE transcripts were detected in all laboratory and field samples with measureable microcystin levels, only mcyE gene copies showed significant positive correlations (R2 > 0.7) with microcystin concentrations, while McyE transcript levels did not. These results suggest that mcyE gene copies are better indicators of potential risks from microcystins than McyE transcript levels or conventional biomass proxies, especially in water bodies comprising mixed assemblages of toxic and nontoxic cyanobacteria.",,,negative regulation of threonine-tRNA ligase activity; Anabolism; Mental association; Microcystin; Proxy; Scientific Publication; Human body; Cyanobacteria; Transcript; Depressive disorder; Biomass; Cyclosporine; cell growth; Hypericum perforatum; Gene Expression; Culture Media; positive regulation of leucine-tRNA ligase activity; Copy (object); organelle membrane contact site,,17/5/2014,,8,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,cyanobacterias,,,,,,,,,,,Microbiology Open,2013,,(Relevance article : X)
,CONSIDERATIONS FOR INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT OF MOOSE IN ALASKA,"The Alaska Legislature recently passed a law directing the Alaska Board of Game to identify certain game populations that will be managed intensively. This mandate implies management for maximum sustained yield (MSY), yet managing populations for MSY is problematic. Overharvest at MS Y may cause populations to decrease to low levels, and in the presence of predation lowdensity equilibria can be established. We recommend maintaining intensively managed populations at densities above the actual point of MSY to avoid potential over-harvests caused by stochastic variation in recruitment. Managing intensively will require better information on factors that influence recruitment and corresponding rates of increase in moose populations, including: age at first reproduction; rates of pregnancy, twinning, age-specific survival, dispersal, and predation; as well as population sex ratios. Population modeling indicates that rate of increase is most sensitive to changes in adult survival, but under most circumstances in real moose populations, calf survival is very important. Factors affecting calf survival include habitat quality, weather, and predation, and the effects of these factors can be minimized by maintaining moose densities slightly above those which maximize recruitment. An intensive management strategy for moose populations in Alaska must include the ability to implement cow harvests, predator management, and habitat management. Aggressive monitoring of population parameters, cause-specific mortality rates, trends in habitat quality, and a knowledge of carrying capacity will be essential to selecting appropriate management strategies. Gaining this information will be expensive but the alternative is potential mismanagement and the risk of population declines. The State of Alaska recently enacted legislation instituting a policy of intensive management of selected ungulate populations. The Alaska Board of Game is charged with identifying populations of moose (Alces alces) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) for which human consumptive use is the primary management objective. These populations are to be managed intensively to produce and maintain high levels of human harvest. A proposed amendment to this legislation defined harvestable surplus as the number of animals born less the number dying, excluding harvest and predation. At least 50% of this harvestable surplus was to be allocated to human harvest. This amendment was passed by the legislature in 1996 15 ALCES VOL. 32 (1996) pp.l5-24 but was vetoed by the governor. Although not stated specifically in the enabling legislation, this intensive management policy implies management for maximum sustained yield (MSY). In this paper, we review briefly the concept of MSY and the reasons why this is not a viable management objective, and we recommend an alternative for optimizing yields. We also review the factors affecting recruitment in moose populations and discuss strategies for managing these factors. While it is impossible to address comprehensive moose management strategies without considering the effect of habitat, we have purposely avoided detailed discussion of habitat evaluation and management. Knowledge of habitat stability (static MANAGING FOR MSYHUNDERTMARK AND SCHWARTZ ALCES VOL. 32 (1996) or seral communities), plant species composition, site characteristics, and the effects of manipulations on non-target wildlife, among other factors is critical to proper habitat management, but these topics have been reviewed elsewhere (e.g., Eastman and Ritcey 1987, Joyal 1987, Oldemeyer and Regelin 1987). Here we only identify the density-dependent relationships between habitat productivity and population parameters. MSY AND POPULATION REGULATION ., Maximum sustained yield occurs when a population is managed at the point of maximum recruitment. Using a logistic growth equation, this point occurs at a population density one-half (K/2) that at nutritional carrying capacity (K). Population growth below this point is density-independent and recruitment increases with population size solely because of the increased number of breeders. Mortality from hunting and predation are largely additive at these low densities. Above MSY, density-dependent processes regulate population growth by reducing fecundity and juvenile survival. Mortality from hunting and predation are increasingly compensatory as densities increase. Management of ungulate populations at MSY is not a new concept, as any densitydependent model of population growth can be used to estimate the density at which MSY is obtained (Caughley 1976). Modeling exercises of ungulate populations indicate that MSY occurs at densities greater than K/2, ranging from 56-72% of K (Caughley 1976, McCullough 1979, Crete eta/. 1981), but we recommend caution in using these estimates. Crete et al. ( 1981) provided the only estimate of MSY for moose (64-72% of K) but they used a definition of K that is less than nutritional carrying capacity. Their estimate of MSY would decrease if expressed as a percentage of nutritional K. In the real world, however, management of ungulate 16 populations at MSY is rarely achieved. The public ultimately decides the density at which ungulate populations will be managed and this often equates to the maximum number of adults that the habitat can support (McCullough 1979). Management at MSY is fraught with risk (Larkin 1977, Holt and Talbot 1978, MacNab 1985). Although once a mainstay of fisheries management, MSY was found to be too difficult to achieve over the long term and often led to declining stocks (Larkin 1977). Setting a harvest level to maintain a population at MSY can result in over-harvest given stochastic variation in recruitment and nonharvest mortality. A model of moose population dynamics indicated that overharvests at MSY can result in drastic population declines (Van Ballenberghe and Dart 1982). Such an overharvest results in a smaller base population which produces fewer recruits the following year. An identical harvest accelerates the decline and continues the positive feedback loop. Current survey and inventory procedures are not likely to detect overharvests or decreasing densities unless they are extreme, at which point drastic management actions will be required to correct the problem. Crete et al. (1981) observed dramatically increased hunter effort at low moose densities in Quebec and suggested that this would serve to reduce harvests at low densities and consequently break the feedback loop. Their data indicate, however, that effort is a sensitive indicator of density only below a density of 0.2 moose/ km2, which is approximately equal to the density at which predation limits moose populations in Alaska and Yukon (Gasaway et al. 1992). Thus, this index would be unsuitable for moose management in Alaska. Predation confounds the management of ungulate populations in many cases, as dynamics of moose and their predators can vary considerably among populations (Van Ballenberghe and Ballard 1994 ). Three forms ALCES VOL. 32 (1996) HUNDERTMARK AND SCHWARTZMANAGING FOR MSY of a general model of wolf (Canis lupus)moose dynamics were proposed by Messier (1994) in which the degree of limitation of moose population growth by wolf predation varies. In general, wolf predation rate increases sharply with moose density at low densities (below approximately 0.65 moose/ km2) and becomes inversely density-dependent at moderate to high moose densities. The relative strengths of predation and habitat productivity determine whether predation will limit moose populations at some equilibrium level below K (Messier 1995). Bear ( U rsus spp.) predation differs from wolf predation in that it is largely independent of moose density (Ballard and Larsen 1987, Schwartz and Franzmann 1991). The combined effect of bear and wolf predation therefore can increase the potential for lowdensity equilibria compared with wolf/moose systems (Gasaway et al. 1992, Messier 1995). In systems with little human intervention and containing both bears and wolves, moose populations limited at low densities are to be expected (VanBallenberghe and Ballard 1994). These same density relationships, however, can be exploited in certain cases where reduction of predation is desired. As neither form of predation is regulatory at moderate moose densities, reduction of one predator will not trigger an increase in predation rate by the other (Dale et al. 1994), which can simplify predator management strategies. Gasaway et al. ( 1992) demonstrated that predation is capable of limiting moose populations at low densities, and Messier and Crete (1985) provided evidence suggesting wolf predation may perhaps regulate moose densities. Therefore, managers attempting to generate harvests from moose populations must strive to maintain high moose densities and low predator: moose ratios. Yet as moose density approaches K, the adverse effects on population stability of density-independent factors such as severe winter weather in17 crease (Skogland 1985), which can cause catastrophic population declines and re-establishment of low-density equilibria. MANAGING POPULATION GROWTH FOR OPTIMUM YIELD When maximum yields from moose populations are desired, we recommend a conservative approach that maintains population size somewhat higher than at MSY and optimizes, rather than maximizes, yield. McCullough ( 1979) defined such a population level as the fixed removal yield and defined it as ""the maximum fixed number of animals that can be removed from a population with fluctuating recruitment withoutdriving the population to extinction"" (McCullough 1979:129). A management objective specifying a range of acceptable population densities is superior to an objective of one fixed density and we concur with Gasaway et al. (1992) that a range of optimum density with MSY as the lower limit of the range is desirable (Fig. 1).

,Cuscuta indecora (Convolvulaceae) new for Canada,"Cuscuta indecora Choisy is frequent msouthern U.SA. (Yuncker 1932, 1965) and extends northward to Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana and Idaho (USDA NRCS2004). The species also occurs mMexico, Central and South America (Yuncker 1932, 1965). Weare reporting here the first record of this species for southern Saskatchewan, Canada. Its presence mthe Canadian Provinces adjacent to its northern range was to be expected, and further f loristic research may reveal its occurrence in southern Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario. Although C indecora has definite weedy tendencies (Parker & Riches 1993), taking into account the natural habitats it was found in, the species may be considered native to southern Canada as well. The species was cultivated experimentally in Ontario and Alberta (vouchers at DAOand ALTA, respectively), but it has never spread (see also Crins & Ford 1988). The host range of C. indecora is wide, in^ eluding numerous herbaceous and woody plants (Yuncker 1965). Cuscuta indecora and C coryli Engelm from subsection Indecorae Yuncker are probably sister species (Costea et al. unpublished).

https://doi.org/10.37099/mtu.dc.etds%2F142,"Detection and landing behavior of emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis , at low population density","The exotic emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), was first discovered in North America in southeastern Michigan in 2002. This beetle has killed millions of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees in several states in the United States and in Canada. This beetle is difficult to detect when it invades new areas or occurs at low density, and for the foreseeable future, girdled trap tree and ground surveys will be important tools for detecting emerald ash borer populations. A field experiment was established at Straits State Park, St. Ignace, Michigan in 2008 to characterize the effectiveness of different trap types in an area of known low density population of emerald ash borer. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of girdled and non-girdled trap trees and the baited prism traps to detect adults and larvae of the emerald ash borer. Canopy assessments of trees were carried out to determine if the canopy condition was predictive of whether a tree was infested with emerald ash borer or not. Adult beetles were not detected using the baited purple prism trap during the trapping survey, and only one adult beetle was caught on a girdled trap tree during the flight season. Eight of the girdled trap trees contained larvae when peeled, and only one tree containing a purple prism trap contained larvae. No non-girdled trap trees were infested. Canopy condition of these trees was not predictive of infestation. Of the girdled trees, infested trees were larger in diameter than non-infested trees. The use of 17 large girdled trap trees may be the most effective tool for detecting emerald ash borer at low density, whereas baited purple prism traps may be ineffective when the population density of the insect is very low. Introduction The exotic emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) (EAB), was first discovered in North America in southeastern Michigan, USA, and Windsor, Ontario, Canada in 2002 (Cappaert et al. 2005, Siegert et al. 2007). This insect pest of North American ash (Fraxinus spp.) is thought to have been introduced into Michigan from Asia in the 1990s based on recent dendrochronological evidence (Cappaert et al. 2005). It has been estimated that approximately 50 million trees have been infested with EAB in Michigan, northern Ohio, and northern Indiana (Smith et al. unpublished). Infestations are also known to occur in Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, USA, and Quebec, Canada (EAB Info 2008). This boring beetle is thought to have arrived from Asia as a stowaway in solid wood packing material (Poland & McCullough 2006), and continues to spread both naturally and from human-assisted movement of ash nursery stock, logs, and firewood, initiating outlier infestations (Poland 2007). In North America, ash species in the genus Fraxinus are the only suitable host of EAB, and are threatened by the continued spread of this pest (Anulewicz et al. 2008). Adult EAB flight starts in May and goes through August with the timing in this window varying according to location.

https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.637546,Determining the Ecological Status of Benthic Coastal Communities: A Case in an Anthropized Sub-Arctic Area,"With the widespread influence of human activities on marine ecosystems, evaluation of ecological status provides valuable information for conservation initiatives and sustainable development. To this end, many environmental indicators have been developed worldwide and there is a growing need to evaluate their performance by calculating ecological status in a wide range of ecosystems at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This study calculated and contrasted sixteen indicators of ecological status from three methodological categories: abundance measures, diversity parameters and characteristic species. This selection was applied to coastal benthic ecosystems at Sept-√éles (Qu√©bec, Canada), an important industrial harbor area in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and related to habitat parameters (organic matter, grain size fractions, and heavy metal concentrations).

https://doi.org/10.3390/F8090326,Development of Northern White-Cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) Plantations within and outside Deer Yards,"Regional surveys done over the last decades show a clear decline in abundance of Northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) throughout its range. A lack of seed trees, difficulties in the establishment of natural regeneration and high browsing pressure caused by increasing deer populations have been identified as plausible causes. Current silvicultural strategies for cedar restoration recommend partial cutting to promote and release natural regeneration, but there is also a need to restore the species in areas where it became absent. Yet, little attention has been given to cedar plantations. This study provides a first characterisation of the effects of competition, silvicultural treatments and deer, moose and hare browsing on planted cedar growth, survival, and stem form. Pure and mixed cedar plantations aged 5‚Äì27 years located in Eastern Quebec were sampled. Both inside and outside deer yards, planted cedars showed high survival rates and were generally subject to low browsing pressure, but 45% were forked. Cedars showed high growth rates and strong reaction to stand opening. Results suggest that at reduced competition levels, a 9-year browser exclusion could be sufficient to establish safe-from-browsing cedar stands of >3 m in height.",,,Orthopedic Fork; Thuja occidentalis; Random seed; Fork (software development); Moose (Perl); Mesa; Hares (mammal); Trees (plant); Exclusion; Natural regeneration; L (complexity); Circuit restoration; Population; Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome,,1/9/2017,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,"Map, range coordinates",Thuja occidentalis,,,,,,,presence only,,,,Forests,2017,,(Relevance article : L)
https://doi.org/10.1002/etc.4941,Diagnostic Fragmentation Filtering for Cyanopeptolin Detection,"Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous photosynthetic prokaryotes that produce structurally diverse bioactive metabolites. Although microcystins are extensively studied, other cyanopeptides produced by common bloom‚Äêforming species have received little attention. Cyanopeptolins are a large cyanopeptide group that contain a characteristic 3‚Äêamino‚Äê6‚Äêhydroxy‚Äê2‚Äêpiperidone (Ahp) moiety. In the present study we used diagnostic fragmentation filtering (DFF), a semitargeted liquid chromatography‚Äêtandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) product ion filtering approach, to investigate cyanopeptolin diversity from 5 Microcystis strains and 4 bloom samples collected from lakes in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. Data processing by DFF was used to search MS/MS data sets for pairs of diagnostic product ions corresponding to cyanopeptolin partial sequences. For example, diagnostic product ions at m/z 150.0912 and 215.1183 identified cyanopeptolins with the NMe‚ÄêTyr‚ÄìPhe‚ÄìAhp partial sequence. Forty‚Äêeight different cyanopeptolins, including 35 new variants, were detected from studied strains and bloom samples. Different cyanopeptolin profiles were identified from each sample. We detected a new compound, cyanopeptolin 1143, from a bloom and elucidated its planar structure from subsequent targeted MS/MS experiments. Diagnostic fragmentation filtering is a rapid, easy‚Äêto‚Äêperform postacquisition metabolomics strategy for inferring structural features and prioritizing new compounds for further study and dereplication. More work on cyanopeptolin occurrence and toxicity is needed because their concentrations in freshwater lakes after blooms can be similar to those of microcystins.

,Distribution Patterns of Birds Associated with Snags in Natural and Managed Eastern Boreal Forests 1,"In boreal forests, several bird species use standing dead trees for feeding or nesting and depend on them for their survival. Studies on wildlife use of snags have shown that their availability is greatly influenced by the age of the forest and the type of perturbation (natural versus anthropogenic). Accordingly, cavity-nesting birds seem largely affected by these changes in availability of snags. In North American boreal forests, relationships between birds and dead wood availability have predominantly been documented in western forests. The dynamics of dead wood and the distribution patterns of birds associated with this habitat feature remain largely unknown in eastern black spruce forests. Distribution patterns of birds associated with dead wood were documented in the eastern black spruce forest of northwestern Quebec, Canada. Study areas were composed of four forest landscapes (50-100 km 2 ) that were naturally disturbed by different fire events (1 year, 20 years, 100 years and > 200 years) and two logged landscapes (20 years, 80 years). Birds were surveyed by point counts. Overall, 348 point counts were distributed over the six forest landscapes. Vegetation plots centered at each point count were used to sample live trees and dead wood. In naturally disturbed forest landscapes, species richness and abundance cavity-nesting birds reached a peak in early post-fire and in mature forest landscapes. Standing dead wood availability and abundance patterns of cavity-nesting birds were significantly less in 20-year-old managed forests landscapes than in those of naturally disturbed forests landscapes. This pattern was persistent in mature forests comparisons between 80-year-old horse-logged second-growth forests and mature forests of post-fire origin. Our results suggest that old-growth forests in this portion of the eastern black-spruce forest ecosystem do not play a key role for cavitynesting birds. Mature and over-mature stands are, however, key habitats for many species of secondary cavity nesters, whereas early post-fire stands are key habitats for primary cavitynesting birds and represent the main source of recruitment for standing dead wood in this ecosystem. Changes in silvicultural practices designed to maintain specific structure of overmature stands (increased partial cutting) may provide a means for maintaining cavity-nesting birds at the landscape scale. Intensification of salvage cutting in early post-fire landscapes is another serious concern in black spruce forests. Reduction in the overall availability of dead wood through such forest practice may affect populations of some primary cavity nesters that are restricted to this specific forest type.",,,Baillie‚ÄìPSW primality test; Ecosystem; Population; Data recovery; Forests; Picea; Rainforest; Trees (plant); Habitat; Recommender system; Aves; Email; Jacques Gauthier; Ecology; The Forest; Conferences; United States Department of Agriculture; Body cavities; Gradient; Persistent data structure,,2002,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,"Map, range coordinates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(Relevance article: X) no data
https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12536,Divergence between riparian seed banks and standing vegetation increases along successional trajectories,"Questions 
Plant community resilience largely depends on the secondary succession induced by species re-colonization from seed banks. Soil seed bank resilience is, however, poorly understood, especially in regularly disturbed habitats like riparian zones. Two questions were asked: what are the changes in species diversity experienced by riparian soil seed banks along successional trajectories, and to what extent do riparian soil seed banks promote vegetation resilience during secondary succession? 
 
Location 
Southeastern Quebec, Canada. 
 
Methods 
Soils were collected along five rivers in field edges and riverbanks of post-agricultural riparian zones with three contrasting successional stages (unplanted ‚Äì planted with trees 15-17¬†years prior to sampling ‚Äì natural riparian forests), and their seed bank composition determined with the seedling emergence method. Species richness in seed banks was assessed along successional trajectories for distinct ecological groups, using linear mixed models. The compositions of soil seed banks and standing vegetation (from botanical surveys) were compared based on NMDS and Indicator Species Analysis. 
 
Results 
Seed bank species richness decreased along successional trajectories. Tree-planted riparian zones were generally closer to unplanted riparian zones than to natural riparian forests, the latter being more species-rich for natives, trees, shrubs and zoochores, and species-poor for exotics, forbs and stress-tolerators. Likewise, seed bank species composition of unplanted and tree-planted riparian zones was similar but differed from those of natural riparian forests. Conversely, standing vegetation of tree-planted riparian zones was intermediate between early- and late-successional stages, at least at field edges. For the three successional stages, seed bank composition clearly differed from standing vegetation. 
 
Conclusions 
The high resilience of riparian plant communities appeared poorly related to the dynamics of their soil seed banks. This species shift between seed banks and standing vegetation during secondary succession is likely due to periodic flooding leading to the regular turnover of seeds. The resilience of riparian communities might thus be more influenced by spatial dispersal along rivers and across landscapes than by in situ temporal dispersal in soils.

https://doi.org/10.1111/ECOG.00836,Does probability of occurrence relate to population dynamics?,"Hutchinson defined species' realized niche as the set of environmental conditions in which populations can persist in the presence of competitors. In terms of demography, the realized niche corresponds to the environments where the intrinsic growth rate (r) of populations is positive. Observed species occurrences should reflect the realized niche when additional processes like dispersal and local extinction lags do not have overwhelming effects. Despite the foundational nature of these ideas, quantitative assessments of the relationship between range-wide demographic performance and occurrence probability have not been made. This assessment is needed both to improve our conceptual understanding of species' niches and ranges and to develop reliable mechanistic models of species geographic distributions that incorporate demography and species interactions. The objective of this study is to analyse how demographic parameters (intrinsic growth rate r and carrying capacity K) and population density (N) relate to occurrence probability (Pocc ). We hypothesized that these relationships vary with species' competitive ability. Demographic parameters, density, and occurrence probability were estimated for 108 tree species from four temperate forest inventory surveys (Qu√©bec, Western US, France and Switzerland). We used published information of shade tolerance as indicators of light competition strategy, assuming that high tolerance denotes high competitive capacity in stable forest environments. Interestingly, relationships between demographic parameters and occurrence probability did not vary substantially across degrees of shade tolerance and regions. Although they were influenced by the uncertainty in the estimation of the demographic parameters, we found that r was generally negatively correlated with Pocc , while N, and for most regions K, was generally positively correlated with Pocc . Thus, in temperate forest trees the regions of highest occurrence probability are those with high densities but slow intrinsic population growth rates. The uncertain relationships between demography and occurrence probability suggests caution when linking species distribution and demographic models.",,,Trees (plant); Demography; Immune Tolerance,,1/12/2014,,2,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ecography,2014,,"(Relevance article: X) No data.

A test with a shallow fluvial lake system,"Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) plays important roles in shallow lakes. In addition to its refuge effect for zooplankton, one key role of SAV is to provide diverse ecological niches to these organisms. The reduction of habitat complexity due to loss of SAV might thus have huge effects on zooplankton communities. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between SAV abundance and composition and zooplankton functional diversity and community structure. We used as model system the littoral zone of Lake St. Pierre (Qu√©bec, Canada), a shallow fluvial lake experiencing dramatic changes in SAV cover. Our sampling protocol allowed us to analyse the relationship between SAV and zooplankton along a gradient of SAV abundance. We showed that SAV abundance explained 41% of the variation in the zooplankton community structure and 25% of the variation in zooplankton functional diversity. Our results also indicated that the presence of the benthic cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia sp. in SAV beds had a structuring effect within the dominant family of Chydoridae, being negatively correlated to the abundance of relatively large-bodied species. Our findings suggest that loss in SAV biomass and complexity can affect both community structure and functional diversity of zooplankton in shallow fluvial lakes.",,,Sampling (signal processing); Community; Complexity; CNS disorder; Beds; SP/k; Zooplankton; Aquatic ecosystem; Challenge‚Äìresponse spam filtering; Gradient,,15/2/2016,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,no,NA,"Map, geospatial feature",Zooplankton families (c.15) and genera (c.15),no,NA,no,NA,80,no,abundance,,,,Hydrobiologia,,,

Adults of most species apparently overwinter in aquatic habitats; however, adults of Laccornis and Hygrotus compar probably overwinter in or adjacent to shallow terre trial sites that may become flooded in the spring. Bidessonotus Regimbart, 1895 Larson and Roughley (1991) reported B. inconspicuus (LeConte, 1955) from Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia, and B. pulicarius (Aube, 1838) from Ontario, but no member of this southern genus was collected in Wisconsin. Although B. inconspicuus was included in the generic key (Hilsenhoff 1992), I believe it is unlikely a y species of Bid s notus occurs in Wisconsin because winter temperatures are probably too cold. Young (1954) provided a key to adults of the three most northern species. Celina Aube 1836 Young (1979) published a key to species in North America and described four new species, inCluding the only one occurring in the north-central United States.

County records: 25, 48;54-55, 57-61, 63-65, 68. Range: ON-PQ-MD-AL-KS. Habitat: Most beetles were collected from shallow len tic habitats with cattails (Typha); Young (1979) commented on their association with cattails. In late September, two students in my class collected several C. hubbelli adults from an aggregation of ""about a hundred"" they found on roots of a cattail. I believe the spinose ends of the abdomen and elytra may be used to pierce cattails and obtain oxygen for respiration in a manner similar to that used by Coquillettidia and Mansonia mosquito larvae. Spangler (1973) sug¬≠ gested the recurved extensions of the lateral tracheal trunks of larvae were also used for that purpose. This would permit both adults and larvae to remain on cattails without having to surface for air. Life Cycle: Adults occurred 13 May to 29 September, most of them in June; teneral adults were found 24 and 29 September. Adults probably over¬≠ winter on roots of cattails and do not become active until mid-May, when the soil in which cattails grow finally: warms. This leads to delayed mating and oviposition, with larvae not completing development until late summer. It is unlikely the teneral adults resulted from a second generation. Identification: The spinose apicies of the abdomen and elytra in Celina are distinctive; the size and brown color, with the basal fourth of t e elytra and pronotum paler, separate C. hubbelli from C. angustata, the most similar species. A larva of Celina from Maryland that was described by Spangler (1973) as C. angustata may have been C. hubbelli, which also occurs in Mary¬≠ land and was not described until 1979. Desmopacbria Babington, 1841 One species of this neotropical genus occurs in the northern United States and Canada. Young (1981) studied the convexa¬∑grana group and provided a key to species of adults. Desmopacbria convexa (Aube, 1838) Distribution and Abundance: Very common statewide (Table 1). County records: 1-27, 29-33, 35-61, 63-72. Range: NT-PE-GA-TX-WY. Habitat: Most adults were collected from ponds, especially smaller ponds in open areas; they also were found in marshes, bogs, swamps, and ditches. Life Cycle: Adults occurred 22 February to 14 November, with substan¬≠ tial numbers being collected in October. Teneral adults (88) were found 16 June to 30 September, all except three from 28 June to 3 September; most later collections were from northern counties. In the laboratory, Barman (1973) reared eggs to adults in about 25 days. Adults apparently overwinter in ponds, then mat and oviposit in late Mayor June; most larvae complete development in July and August. The life cycle is probably univoltine. but a partial second generation may occur in some years. Identification: The very small size, almost round shape. and rather uni¬≠ formly brown color make adults easy to recognize. In Wisconsin they most resemble adults ofHygrotus farctus, which are about the same size and nearly the same shape and color; however. adults of that species have much longer antennae and longer legs with basally narrowed and slightly arcuate tibiae.

,Eastern-breeding Lesser Yellowlegs are more likely than western-breeding birds to visit areas with high shorebird hunting during southward migration,"Shorebirds have experienced a precipitous reduction in abundance over the past four decades. While some threats to shorebirds are widespread (e.g., habitat alteration), others are regional and may affect specific populations. Lesser Yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes) are long-distance migrants that breed across the North American boreal biome and have declined in abundance by 60‚Äì80% since the 1970s. The documented harvest of Lesser Yellowlegs in the Caribbean and northeastern South America during southward migration is a possible limiting factor for the species, but it is unknown to what extent birds from different breeding origins may be affected. To address the question of differential occurrence in harvest zones during southward migration, we used PinPoint GPS Argos transmitters to track the southward migrations of 85 adult Lesser Yellowlegs from across the species‚Äô breeding range and 80¬∞ of longitude from Anchorage, Alaska, USA, to the Mingan Archipelago, Quebec, Canada. We classified migratory locations as inside or outside three zones with high levels of harvest (Caribbean, coastal Guianas, and coastal Brazil) and then fit generalized additive mixed models to estimate the probability of occurrence of Lesser Yellowlegs in harvest zones according to their breeding origin. Individuals from the Eastern Canada population had a higher probability of occurrence within one or more harvest zones and remained in those zones longer than individuals breeding in Alaska and western Canada. Linear regressions also suggested that longitude of the breeding origin is an important predictor of occurrence in harvest zones during southward migration. Lastly, our findings, combined with other sources of evidence, suggest that current estimated harvest rates may exceed sustainable limits for Lesser Yellowlegs, which warrants further investigation.",,,,,2021,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,Lesser Yellowlegs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(Relevance article: X) No data.

However, other ecological factors may also be important, especially when the northern limit of the dominant species of a vegetation zone extends further than the limit of the zone itself. This study aimed to identify the ecological variables explaining the transition between two zones within the boreal biome in Quebec (eastern Canada): the southern mixedwood forests dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and white birch (Betula papyrifera), and the northern coniferous forests dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana).



Location‚ÄÇ Quebec (eastern Canada).



Methods‚ÄÇ Data from 5023 sampling plots from the ecological inventory of the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources distributed throughout the two bioclimatic zones were used in logistic regressions to determine the relationships between the presence or absence of balsam fir stands and different abiotic and biotic variables, at both stand and landscape scales.



Results‚ÄÇ The presence of balsam fir stands was negatively related to the thick organic horizons, coarse xeric deposits and low positions on the slope, whereas stands were favoured by high elevations, steep slopes and moderate drainage. These results defined the suitable conditions for the development of balsam fir stands. In the coniferous zone these suitable conditions were less abundant. Furthermore, the saturation level of suitable sites was lower, as well as the incidence of balsam fir stands in unsuitable sites (overflow).

 Canadian peatlands are subject to disturbance and destruction, and drainage for agriculture is responsible for 85% of this degradation. Few studies have explicitly addressed the effects of habitat degradation on arthropod diversity in Nearctic peatlands. Because higher Diptera (Brachycera) in peatlands are diverse, are an important component of food webs, and exhibit a wide range of ecological requirements, we examined species richness, abundance, and community composition of Brachycera across transects at 1, 6, and 11 m from a collector drainage ditch in Johnville Bog and Forest Park, Quebec. In total, 1453 Brachycera were collected, representing 24 families and 166 species. Species diversity (based on Simpson's diversity index) and rarefaction-estimated species richness were higher at 6 and 11 m than at 1 m from the ditch, probably because of the homogeneous moss cover and moister conditions at greater distance from the ditch. Species composition also differed between 1 m and other distances, based on cluster analysis, multiresponse permutation procedures analysis, and the presence of five predaceous species that were significant indicator species 1 m from the drainage ditch. Our results suggest that anthropogenic degradation of hydrological conditions may be responsible for the low species richness and high dominance of a few species currently seen at the ditch margin.",,,,,1/4/2010,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,site coordinates,166 species of insects of order Brachycera (Dyptera),,,,,,,presence only,,,,The Canadian Entomologist,2012,,"(Relevance article: M) In the appendix, the species names are provided"

We evaluated the relative effects of urban and agricultural landscapes on anuran species richness and the abundance of six anuran species found at breeding ponds in and around the cities of Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec. We performed six call surveys at 29 permanent focal ponds surrounded by one of three landscape contexts: primarily urban, primarily agricultural, and primarily forested. We also measured three local pond variables to control for the effects of local habitat quality in our analyses. We found that anuran species richness was significantly lower in breeding ponds in urban landscapes compared to forested and agricultural landscapes, which exhibited no significant difference in species richness. The abundances of individual anuran species were also consistently lower in urban landscapes for all species except one, which exhibited no response to landscape type. Three species had their highest abundances in ponds in forested landscapes, whereas two species had their highest abundances in ponds in agricultural landscapes. We conclude that ponds embedded in urban landscapes support lower biodiversity than ponds in agricultural settings. We suggest that landscapes composed of a mosaic of forest and open habitats surrounding wetlands would hold the highest biodiversity of these species.",,,Cooperative breeding; Community; Wetlands; Habitat; Ecosystem; FOCAL (programming language); Terrestrial television; Embedded system,,27/1/2007,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,Landscape Ecology,2007,,(Relevance article: X) no data.
,Effects from environmental Mn exposures: a review of the evidence from non-occupational exposure studies.,"OBJECTIVE
The risk posed to human health by environmental manganese exposure is unknown. Occupational-exposure outcomes may not extrapolate to environmental exposures due to the healthy worker effect and differences in dosage parameters which may affect the biological response. This paper attempts to combine the existing literature on non-occupational Mn exposures with results from our current study in SW Quebec on environmental Mn exposure (Mergler et al., this issue) within the framework of a biologically-based, dose-response (BBDR) model. BBDR MODEL: The basic BBDR model consists of seven stages relating exposure to health effects. The stages are: 1) sources, 2) applied dose, 3) absorbed dose, 4) target-site dose, 5) toxic event, 6) measurable change, and 7) health outcome.


RESULTS
Several air monitoring programs, such as the PTEAM study (Riverside, CA, 1990, mean PM10 Mn outdoor-airborne 24 h average = 0.045 microgram/m3), provided data relevant to the estimation of Mn applied dose, but did not include measures of body burden. Data from the SW Quebec study showed a mean total-particulate airborne Mn concentration of 0.022 microgram/m3 with a range of 0.009 to 0.035 microgram/m3 across four sampling sites, whereas the EPA reference concentration (RfC) is 0.05 microgram/m3. EPA has considered tap water levels to be safe below 200 micrograms/l Mn, and mean Mn tap-water (MnW) level in the participants' homes was 6.38 +/- 11.95 micrograms/l with a range from 0.1 to 158.9 micrograms/l Mn. A previous study of MnW exposure in Greece reported Mn levels in areas with low, medium and high MnW ranging from 4 to 2,300 micrograms/l and a significant association with Mn in hair but not Mn in blood (MnB). The mean absorbed dose of the SW Quebec study participants, as indicated by MnB, was 7.5 +/- 2.3 micrograms/l with a range of 2.5 to 15.9 micrograms/l. Our study and others on environmental Mn exposure did not provide an estimate of target-site dose. However, a significant correlation (r = 0.65) between MnB and signal intensity in T1-weighted MRI images has been reported in liver-disease patients with Parkinson-like signs who had MnB levels as low as 6.6 micrograms/l. Only animal and in vitro studies have provided evidence on the mechanisms of toxicity caused by Mn in the CNS. Several studies reported measurable changes in endpoints suggestive of a Parkinson-like syndrome in subjects with MnB levels ranging from 7.5 to 25.0 micrograms/l. Among other effects on neurobehavioral function observed in the current study was a significant relationship between MnB and the direction and speed of body-sway in men. The effects observed in these participants are sub-clinical and no health outcomes have been diagnosed. However, the Parkinson's disease incidence in the study area was previously reported to be 2-5 times higher than in the rest of Quebec, and several studies indicate that 25-35% of idiopathic Parkinson disease diagnoses are incorrect. Our study, the Greek study, and some clinical studies suggest that the risk of a Parkinson-like syndrome diagnosis may increase with continued Mn exposure and aging.


CONCLUSION
The limited data available for the BBDR model point to the need for evidence, particularly on relationships between Mn species, exposure route, MnB with chronic environmental exposure, ageing, and susceptibility factors, to improve human-health risk assessments for chronic, environmental Mn exposure.",,,Risk Assessment; In Vitro [Publication Type]; Parkinsonian Disorders; Adverse reaction to drug; Occupational Diseases; Eicosapentaenoic Acid; Body Burden; Particulate (substance); Environmental Exposure; Aging; Parkinson Disease; Liver diseases,,1/4/1999,,7,semantic_scholar,,,,other,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not related to biodiversity (effect of Mn on human health)

We hypothesized that habitat modifications through logging and forest fire alter the space-use pattern of woodland caribou and result ultimately in lowered density. To test this hypothesis, density, distribution, space-use patterns, and mortality of caribou in disturbed landscapes (DLs) and undisturbed landscapes (ULs) of central Qu√©bec were quantified by a systematic aerial survey (42 539 km2) and telemetry of 68 adult caribou females. A ground survey of terrestrial and arboreal lichens was carried out to estimate production of lichens in DLs and ULs. Three populations that occupied between 10 000 and 15 000 km2 were identified in the study area. Caribou abundance was not limited by intraspecific competition for food. Production of terrestrial lichens was estimated to support 3 to 4 times the surveyed caribou density (1.2‚Äì2.1‚Äì100 km‚àí2). Pregnancy rate was almost 100%, indicating that females were not food-limited. Space-use patterns were affected by forest disturbance. In DLs, caribou increased home range sizes and reduced fidelity to seasonal and annual home ranges, probably to avoid disturbed habitats. In response, the probability of surviving decreased with the extent of DL within home ranges. To help keep direct and indirect sources of caribou mortality at very low levels, forest management strategies should be oriented toward the protection of large interconnected blocks of forest to favour caribou spacing away from humans and predators and to maintain adequate space-use strategies.",,,,,1/12/2007,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bio One,2007,,

These species are often the main community primary producers and have a major role in the establishment of organisms through facilitation processes. This study focuses on macroalgae and mussels as HFS within an intertidal zone along the St. Lawrence estuary (Quebec, Canada). Over a 16-week period, we manipulated the in situ diversity profile (richness, evenness, identity, and abundance) of the dominant HFS (Fucus distichus edentatus, F. vesiculosus, and Mytilus spp.) in order to define their role in both the establishment of associated species and community primary production. Contrary to expectation, no general change in HFS richness, evenness, abundance, or identity on associated species community establishment was observed. However, over the study period, the HFS diversity profile modified the structure within the trophic guilds, which may potentially affect further community functions. Also, our results showed that the low abundance of HFS had a negative impact on the primary productivity of the community. Our results suggest that HFS diversity profiles have a limited short-term role in our study habitat and may indicate that biological forcing in these intertidal communities is less important than environmental conditions. As such, there was an opportunistic establishment of species that ensured rapid colonization regardless of the absence, or the diversity profile, of facilitators such as HFS.",,,"negative regulation of reactive oxygen species biosynthetic process; Community; Hyalinosis, Systemic; Seaweed; Estuaries",,14/10/2014,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,appendix,.doc,NA,"site coordinates, administrative unit","site coordinates, administrative unit","Benthic intertidal community (c.20 algae, c.15 molluscs, c.15 annelid species, and others)",2011,source publication text,1,no,no,no,density,,,,Plos One,,,(Relecance article: M) Data is a list of species in Supporting Information
,Effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors on biomarkers of fish health in spottail shiners (Notropis hudsonius),"Parasites and pollution are natural and anthropogenic stressors respectively in fishes. A range of biomarkers have been used to assess the sublethal effects of pollutants in fish, but few studies have examined sublethal effects of parasites and pollution in combination. I examined seven biomarkers (pigmented macrophage centres and pigmented macrophage counts in the spleen, pigmented macrophage counts in the liver, white blood cell counts, haematocrit, leucocrit, and condition factor) and parasite abundances in 204 (age 1+ and 2+) spottail shiners ( Notropis hudsonius ) collected at three polluted and two reference localities in the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada. The number of pigmented macrophage centres and pigmented macrophages in the spleen was significantly higher at polluted localities than at reference localities. Seven of the nine species of parasites found in 1+ fish showed significant correlations with biomarkers. More parasites (18 species) but few significant correlations were observed in 2+ fish, indicating that parasite effects are more pronounced in young spottail shiners. A significant negative relationship was observed between condition factor and Neoechinorhynchus rutili (Acanthocephala) in 1+ fish, indicating its potential pathological significance in fish. High abundance of Plagioporus sinitsini (Digenea) was associated with increased spleen macrophage counts and decreased condition factor at polluted localities. Results suggest that counts of spleen macrophages and macrophage centres are good indicators of exposure to pollution in spottail shiners. Furthermore, infection by P. sinitsini in under polluted conditions appears to a greater negative impact on fish health than either stressor alone.",,,Biological Markers; Shiner,,2006,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imagines were collected throughout the mid-May to mid-September 1980 sampling period with most emergence occurring in spring and autumn. Over 95% of the emergence consisted of Hastaperla brevis and Malenka californica. Peak emergence of H. brevis occurred in late spring. Malenka californica had two different emergence patterns; at two stations, one in each stream, emergence began in midto late June and continued, intermittently, to the end of the sampling period with lowest emergence occurring during July and August. At all other stations, emergence was mainly restricted to late August and September. Sex ratios in each species were either approximately equal or there were generally more or only females collected. In species where large numbers of animals emerged, emergence of sexes overlapped. These are the first records of M. californica and Suwallia pallidula for the Province of Manitoba. INTRODUCTION Studies of insect emergence are valuable in providing information on diversity and seasonal occurrence of aquatic insects. Systematic studies of seasonal emergence of Plecoptera in Canada have been conducted in Quebec (Harper and Magnin, 1969; Harper and Pilon, 1970), Ontario (Sprules, 1947; Harper, 1973a, b; Harper and Hynes, 1972), Saskatchewan (Dosdall and Lehmkuhl, 1979) and Alberta (Radford and Hartland-Rowe, 1971; Donald and Anderson, 1977). No emergence studies of Plecoptera in Manitoba have been published. This paper describes an investigation of species composition, emergence periods, spatial distribution and abundance of adult Plecoptera, based on emergence data obtained over most of the open-water season, from two small, permanent streams in the Duck Mountain Region of W-central Manitoba. METHODS South Duck River (SD) and Cowan Creek (C), originate on the Manitoba Escarpment and flow into Lake Winnipegosis. The streams are spring-fed and are ice-covered in winter. Emergence trap stations were located on the Manitoba Escarpment (52048'N, 100040'W). Stations SD1, C1, C2 and C3 were located in areas with mixed forest (spruce, aspen, birch); the remaining stations were surrounded by forested and agricultural lands. Stream habitats ranged from fast-flowing riffle areas to siltbottomed pools. General features, including substrate types, of areas where emergence trap stations were located are listed in Table 1. Two 1 m2 emergence traps (Flannagan, 1978) were set at each station except at C4 where there was only one. One trap at each station was located over a riffle and the other over a pool, except at SD3 which had no pool areas and where both traps were located over riffle areas. Each trap was cleared every 2nd day and specimens were preserved in 70% alcohol. Sampling began 11 May 1980 and continued until 19 September 1980, except for Cl and C2 where sampling began on 21 May 1980.

These tailings are colonized by an active population of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans which is localized to an acid zone occupying 40% of the tailings' surface. This population peaked at 7 √ó 108 most probable number per gram of tailings during July and August 1990 and extended to a depth of 40 cm from the surface. Examination of samples over this depth profile by transmission electron microscopy and electron dispersive spectroscopy revealed a microbially mediated mineral transition from sulfides (below 40 cm) to chlorides and phosphates (at the surface). Silicate minerals were unaltered by microbial action. Transmission electron microscopy showed a tight association between Thiobacillus species and the sulfide minerals, which helps account for their prominence in tailings environments. Accurate enumeration of T. ferrooxidans from tailings required the disruption of their bonding to the mineral interface. Vortexing of a 10% aqueous suspension of the tailings material prior to most-probable-number analysis best facilitated this release. Even though heavy metals were highly mobile under acidic conditions at the Lemoine tailings, it was evident by transmission electron microscopy and electron dispersive spectroscopy that they were being immobilized as bona fide fine-grain minerals containing iron, copper, chlorine, phosphorus, and oxygen on bacterial surfaces and exopolymers.

The study was carried out in the forests surrounding Lake Duparquet, in the southwestern part of Qu√©bec's boreal forest. Stands representing different post-fire successional stages, corresponding to 278, 125, 79, and 51 yr since the last fire were selected. For each stand age, 10 trees from four different sites were sampled. A total of 75 species of non-vascular plants were found, including 34 species of mosses, seven species of liverworts, and 34 species of lichens. More species were observed in the 278-yr old stand, which also contained a greater number of exclusive species. In a correspondence analysis performed on species presence/absence data, axes one and two were correlated with distance from the closest unburnt area and time since fire.

By using mixed log-linear models, we found that the frequency of occurrence of some species was linked to the time since fire, and others species to tree age. Old-growth forests are important to bryophytes and lichens since they have a greater number of species and some species are found exclusively or more frequently in old-growth forests.

PREMISE OF THE STUDY
In ecosystems where seed production is low and masting years are sporadic, or with species that have short-lived seeds, regeneration is assured by seedling banks rather than seed banks. Seedling establishment and survival play a critical role in determining the composition of these plant communities by supplying new individuals for their maintenance. Seedling emergence and mortality were investigated to test the hypothesis that recruitment into the seedling bank is periodic. ‚Ä¢


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Seed production and seedling emergence and survival was monitored during 1994-2007 in balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and white spruce (Picea glauca) in four pristine stands of the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. Measurements were collected twice per month by sampling one permanent plot of 20 √ó 20 m per stand. ‚Ä¢


KEY RESULTS
Seed-rain abundance reached 9 √ó 10(3) seeds m(-2) year(-1), and was characterized by synchronous sequences of low and high seed production. New seedlings appeared only during the year following a seed production of at least 1 √ó 10(3) and 1.5 √ó 10(2) seeds m(-2) year(-1) for balsam fir and white spruce, respectively. Seedlings emerged in July and survived 34-52 d on average, with balsam fir showing a longer lifespan and lower mortality, although 85-99% of seedlings died before completing one year of life. ‚Ä¢


CONCLUSIONS
The emergence of young seedlings was coupled with massive seed rains, which allowed synchronous replenishment of the seedling banks among stands and species, and generated different cohorts, yielding a discontinuous age structure.",,,Ninety Nine; Abies; Community; Bank (environment); Plant seeds; Balsams; Picea; Rain; Cessation of life; Seed Bank; Ecosystem; Seedlings,,1/12/2012,,8,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,"Abies balsamea, Picea glauca",1994-2007,,,,,,,,,,American Journal of Botany,2012,,

Recently, a dynamic model for primary infections of grapes by Plasmopara viticola, forecasting time of primary lesions emergence, was developed in Italy. The model simulates the development of predicted oospore cohorts during the primary infection period. The efficacy of this disease-cycle-based model was evaluated in eastern Canada by comparing the time of lesion emergence predicted by the model with field observations in 20 and 23 vineyards in 2008 and 2009, respectively. For each vineyard, one to 20 simulation runs were performed depending on the number of oospore cohorts expected to form, for a total of 545 simulations. The model evaluation was based on the true positive proportion (lesion emergence was predicted and observed) and the true negative proportion (lesion emergence was not predicted and not observed) which were 0.996, and 0.907, respectively. A total of 313 simulations resulted in no infection among which 284 corresponded to no lesion emergence. In only one situation, lesions were observed and not predicted by the model. On the contrary, in 29 simulations run, lesion emergence was predicted but not observed in the field. Further validation of this model is required, but the results of this study are encouraging and this model may be used to improve timing of fungicide sprays against P. viticola. Introduction In eastern Canada, as well as in several viticultural areas, downy mildew, caused by Plasmopara viticola (Berk et Curt.) Berlese et de Toni, represents one of the most important grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) diseases. The warm and wet spring with abundant rainfall generally occurring in the spring favor disease development (13). The pathogen, native to North America, infects most species of Vitis with vinifera cultivars being highly susceptible and wild species relatively resistant. The pathogen attacks all aerial parts of the vines, causing indirect losses (leaf, shoot, and tendrils infections, Fig 1A) or direct losses (berry infections, Fig. 1B). In addition, the quality of wine produced from infected grapes is reduced (21). Grape downy mildew epidemics can progress rapidly and can cause economic losses up to 100%; hence, growers attempt to limit this threat by managing their fungicide program as though a disease risk is always present. However, increasing fungicide, fuel, and labor costs make routine use of fungicides costly. This strategy has several disadvantages, not only from an economic point of view but also with regard to the environmental impact of fungicides. In this context, the use of decision-support systems and of simulation models that predict ‚Äúreal risk‚Äù represents a valid alternative to calendar-based fungicide spray program. 26 January 2011 Plant Health Progress Like most polycyclic diseases, epidemics of grape downy mildew entail a sequence of events initiated by the production and dispersal of initial inoculum, followed by primary infections, production and dispersal of secondary inoculum, and completed by survival of P. viticola. Recent molecular studies showed the preponderant effect of primary infections on the epidemic (8,9,24). Gobbin et al. (8,9) analyzed more than 10,000 isolates of P. viticola from 39 vineyards using microsatellite markers and found numerous infections originating from primary inoculum from May to August. Furthermore, they reported that genotypes identified once throughout the sampling period always constituted the dominant class (71% of all genotypes) regardless of the sampling date. Only one or two genotypes per epidemic developed into secondary cycles and generated a high number of progenies. In other words, epidemics of grape downy mildew are strongly influenced by primary inoculum and hence controlling them is crucial for adequate management of the disease. The relationship of temperature and relative humidity to downy mildew development and P. viticola reproduction serve as the basis for most prediction systems. Grape downy mildew prediction models have been proposed for identifying the periods of high risk (i.e. conditions are favorable for disease development) and for scheduling fungicide applications (16,23). Some of these models are based on the simulation of primary infection development such as the POM (26), EPI (25), SIMPO (10), DMCAST (20), and UCSC (23) models. While other models predict the development of secondary infections through a simulation of one or more stages of P. viticola biological cycle (3,6,15,18,19). Despite the availability of warning systems for management of grape downy mildew, Quebec‚Äôs growers generally apply fungicides in a preventative manner starting soon after the green tip phenological stage or based on the 3-10 rule (2). This rule is based on the concurrent occurrence of: (i) air temperature equal to or greater than 10¬∞C; (ii) vine shoots at least 10 cm long; (iii) a minimum of 10 mm of rainfall in the past 24 to 48 h. Considering the frequent spring to early summer occurrence of temperatures above 10¬∞C and rainfall, this rule basically relies on the phonological criteria (vine shoots at least 10 cm long) and does not accounts for the development of the pathogen. The objective of this study was to evaluate under the conditions of eastern Canada, the potential of a new dynamic model for predicting P. viticola development during the initial phase of the disease development (23) for predicting the emergence of the primary lesions. Model Description The model was previously described in detail (23). Briefly, it is a dynamic model developed following a mechanistic approach according to principles of systems analysis (22). The model simulates, with a time step of one hour, the entire process of downy mildew primary infection: oospore maturation and 26 January 2011 Plant Health Progress germination, then zoospore ejection and dispersal, and finally infection establishment and disease symptom onset. This process was separated into different stages: the pathogen changes from one stage to another at different rates, depending on environmental conditions (Fig. 2). Pathogen stages are considered as state variables and their changes are regulated by rate variables; weather conditions influence rates acting as parameters or intermediate variables. Hourly temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and rainfall (R) from 1 January were used as input data in the model. A simulation was initiated by each rainfall wetting the leaf litter and triggering the oospore germination process. In this model, it is assumed that oospores are present. At this time, the oospores which have broken dormancy form a cohort which develops in a similar way. An assumption of the model is that the germination process is temperature dependent when humidity of the leaf litter is not a limiting factor. The model simulates all the primary infection cycle of P. viticola (23). After germination, sporangia present on the leaf litter release zoospore in the presence of water; otherwise sporangia can survive for a few days and then die, depending on temperature and relative humidity. Zoospores are splashed by rain droplets and aerosols to grape leaves, but if the litter surface dries before rainfall zoospores do not survive. Infection establishment is caused by deposited zoospores when wetness duration and the corresponding temperature are favorable. If the leaf litter surface dries the zoospores dry out and die. The length of incubation period is influenced by temperature and relative humidity. At the end of the incubation period lesions develop at the infection sites. 26 January 2011 Plant Health Progress Field Observations The field observations used to evaluate the model were collected by government and private grape specialists and scouts in 20 and 23 vineyards in 2008 and 2009, respectively, located in the south of the province of Quebec, near the US border, and the north of the province (L‚ÄôIle d‚ÄôOrleans) (Fig. 3). Vineyards were selected based on availability of scouting data and the presence of susceptible cultivars. The vineyards selected for this evaluation are 26 January 2011 Plant Health Progress representative of the different grapevine-growing areas, for soil type, varieties, training systems and cropping regimes. They also represent a range of dose of overwintering inoculum because of different fungicide spray programs, environmental conditions and geographical locations. Starting from bud burst, each vineyard was inspected at a 3 or 4 day-interval, to detect the emergence of the first lesions expressed as ‚Äúoil spots‚Äù on leaves. At each assessment, all leaves on 50 to 100 vines, depending on vineyard size, were assessed for the presence of downy mildew lesions. Since the oil spots could have been appeared on each single day between the last negative and the first positive scouting, the actual symptoms onset was expressed as an ‚Äúonset window‚Äù (Fig. 4). 26 January 2011 Plant Health Progress Hourly temperature (¬∞C), relative humidity (%) and rainfall (mm) were obtained from the nearest (not more than 15 km) automatic weather station operated by Environment Canada available. The model was used to simulate, for each year and each vineyard, the progress of downy mildew for each predicted oospore cohort from 1 January to the emergence of the lesions (23). For a small number of vineyards located near to each other data from the same weather station were used. Methods for Model Evaluation For each vineyard, one to 20 simulations were performed depending on the number of oospore cohorts expected to be formed (presence of rain), for a total of 545 simulations. All simulations were divided into two groups based on observed lesion emergence; the cases and the controls were defined as the simulation with lesion emergence observed (O+) or not observed (O-), respectively. Within each group, simulations were further divided into two groups based on positive (P+) and negative (P-) prediction",,,,,2010,,8,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,Plasmopara viticola,,,,,,,,,,, Plant health progress,2011,,

(Lamiaceae), known commonly as crested late-summer mint and Vietnamese balm, is an annual herb native to Asia. The species is known to naturalize in northeastern North America and is documented in six New England counties in the Flora of the Northeast (Magee and Ahles 1999) and five counties in the Massachusetts County Checklist (Cullina et al. 2011). Weldy and Werier (2012) recorded the species in four counties in New York, and statewide records exist for all northeastern states excepting Rhode Island and New Hampshire (USDA, NRCS 2012). It is also reported for Quebec, Ontario, and New Brunswick (Natureserve 2012). In this region, E. ciliata appears to tolerate a wide range of conditions in disturbed habitats (Mehrhoff et al. 2003) but has been noted as often being associated with granular riparian and floodplain soils (e.g., Gleason and Cronquist 1991, Rhoads and Block 2000). The first record of Elsholtzia ciliata in Clinton County, NY, was collected in 2009 by Timothy Shearman and C. Martine [1 September 2009, Martine & Shearman s.n. (PLAT)] during wetland/ riparian community surveys being conducted in the Ausable Marsh Wildlife Management Area in Peru, NY (Shearman 2011). This wetland complex is part of an extensive delta at the mouth of the Ausable River, a renowned trout stream that flows into Lake Champlain at the eastern edge of the Adirondack Park. An expanded search for E. ciliata found that the species is locally widespread, but especially abundant along the south bank of the river beginning around 600 meters downstream from the historic Carpenter‚Äôs Flats Bridge (Route 9, Peru, NY).

With taxonomic priority by one year, its monotypic family is reduced to Floridobolinae, n. stat., comprising Floridobolini and Tylobolini, n. stats., the counterpart to Spirobolinae, comprising Spirobolini and Aztecolini, n. tribe; relationships are Floridobolini + (Tylobolini + (Aztecolini + Spirobolini)). Like F. penneri Causey, 1957, 208 km (130 mi) to the south in the Lake Wales Ridge, Polk and Highlands counties (cos.), F. orini n. sp., inhabits ‚ÄúBig Scrub‚Äù environments in the Ocala National Forest, Marion Co. Biogeographic reconstructions, compatible with broader hypotheses on the class‚Äô evolutionary history, indicate that, from a presumptive source area in northern Mexico where the subfamilies overlap, spirobolid stock penetrated the ‚Äúproto-US‚Äù four times, once per tribe, before the Western Interior Seaway developed in the Cretaceous Period, Mesozoic Era. Three expansions headed northeastward into future ‚ÄúAppalachia,‚Äù from which taxa spread southward as the Seaway receded. Floridobolini, the fi rst invader, had to be in ‚Äúproto-Georgia‚Äù and positioned to penetrate Florida when the sand dunes that comprise the ‚ÄúCentral Highlands‚Äù emerged from the sea in the Oligocene (Cenozoic), ~25 mya. As sea levels rose and fell, the dunes fragmented into islands and the subcontinuous Floridobolus population was partitioned. The southernmost became F. penneri; F. orini inhabited a northern island; and a graduate student is investigating other insular remnants for additional species. Shortly after Floridobolini began spreading, Hiltonius/ Tylobolini arose and expanded both southward to Guatemala and northwestward to California; Tylobolus Cook, 1904, diverged in the latter area and dispersed northward to Washington and eastward to Utah/Arizona. The third invader, and the second to disperse northeastward, was Aztecolini, which probably eradicated Floridobolini from some of its established range and was partitioned into Mexican (Aztecolus Chamberlin, 1943) and US (Chicobolus Chamberlin, 1947) taxa by the Seaway. The fi nal invader, Spirobolini, dispersed northwestward and northeastward to both the Pacifi c and Atlantic coasts; instead of Trans-Beringia, we prefer penetration of the Asian part of ‚ÄúAsiamerica,‚Äù when it temporarily formed during the Cretaceous, to explain the Mongolian fossil genus, Gobiulus Dzik, 1975, herein assigned to Tylobolini, and the occurrence of Spirobolus Brandt, 1833, in China and Taiwan today. In the east, Narceus Rafi nesque, 1820, spread across Appalachia, eradicated most remaining populations of Floridobolus and Chicobolus, and expanded to Maine and Qu√©bec after retreat of the Wisconsin glaciation. Chicobolus and Narceus also penetrated earliest Florida; the former established itself in the Central Highlands, spread through the widening peninsula as sea levels fell, and remained on insular refugia when waters rose. Apparently fueled by the different Floridian environments, Narceus underwent time-consuming speciation; consequently, Floridobolus and Chicobolus still survive on the peninsula, and an allopatric population of the latter inhabits coastal South Carolina. However, N. gordanus (Chamberlin, 1943) occurs syntopically with both in peninsular Florida and may be actively eradicating them from their last stronghold. Trigoniulus niger, takahasii, and segmentatus, all by Takakuwa, 1940, are removed from Spirobolidae and returned toTrigoniulidae (Trigoniulidea).

marine mammals and thus, support annually many species. However, this marine 
ecosystem is under a strong anthropogenic pressure by various human activities (i. e. 
maritime traffic, fisheries, tourism etc .). Additionally, long- term monitoring of the 
ecosystem demonstrates considerable changes of environmental conditions. To identify and 
characterize the impact of these changes on the marine mammal community, we analyzed 
the occunence of stranding events from 1994 to 2008. Overall , the number of strandings 
and anthropogenic incidences increase annually and are higher in summer, season when 
human activities are particularly intense and when the majority of species are present. 
Environmental models show that water conditions (volume of the cold intermediate water 
layer, sea surface temperature, freshwater runoff) influenced stranding events in most 
species. lce coyer indeed influenced negatively the strandings of pagophilic seal species 
and mysticete. Krill abundance specifically influenced stranding even ts in harbour porpoise 
and minke whale. We identified in August 2008 an unusual event involving a high number 
of strandings of various species (beluga, harbour por-poise, harbour and grey seals). This 
event was caused by a bloom of toxic algae (Alexandrium tamarense) in the Estuary. 
Conceming the analysis of anthropogenic factors, we identified an increase of the number 
of entanglements mainly of minke and humpback whales, in some years exceeding the 
potential biological removal (PBR) of the minke whale stock of the Estuary and the Gulf of 
St. Lawrence. Three hypotheses were suggested to explain this tendency: i) bias in effort, 
ii) changes in the distribution of minke whales and iii) changes in fishery practices. We also 
observed an increase in anthropogenic events involving the harbour porpoise in the 
Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park. The nature of these events suggests illegal hunting. 
This project allowed to valid the use of strandings as a monitoring tool to demonstrate the 
influence of environmental changes and anthropogenic activities on the marine mammal 
community of the Estuary and the northwestern Gulf of St. Lawrence.",,,Linear algebra; Method of analytic tableaux; Biblioth√®que de l'√âcole des Chartes; Diethylstilbestrol,,1/10/2010,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,H,article,article,no,NA,"Map, geological feature",marine mammals (c.22 species),1994-2008,"source publication text, dataset",14,no,200000,no,abundance,,,,,,,

https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-005-1393-1,Factors Responsible for the Co-occurrence of Forested and Unforested Rock Outcrops in the Boreal Forest,"Rock outcrops in the boreal forest of Qu√©bec can show either of two different states: a forested state with >25% tree cover, and an unforested state (<25% tree cover). We tested three different hypotheses that might explain the co-occurrence of forested and unforested rock outcrops: (1) differences in bedrock geology, with unforested outcrops associated to bedrock types inimical to tree growth; (2) unforested outcrops as recently disturbed sites undergoing secondary succession towards a forested state; (3) unforested outcrops as an alternative stable state to forested outcrops, induced by post-fire regeneration failure. Digitized forest inventory maps were used along with bedrock geology maps and time-since-fire maps to compare forested and unforested outcrops for bedrock geology type and date of the last fire. Field surveys were conducted on 28 outcrops (14 forested, 14 unforested) to gather information regarding tree species composition and site characteristics (thickness of the organic matter layer, percent cover of lichens, mosses and ericaceous shrubs). None of the three hypotheses explain the co-occurrence of forested and unforested rock outcrops in the boreal forest of Qu√©bec. Both outcrop types occur on the same bedrock geology types. Unforested outcrops are not recently disturbed sites in early-successional states, as no clear distinction could be made in tree species composition and date of the last fire between the two outcrop types. Forested and unforested outcrops are not alternative stable states, as unforested outcrops are unstable and cannot maintain themselves through time in the prolonged absence of fire. Hence, unforested rock outcrops could be viewed as degraded, diverging post-fire types maintained by the late Holocene disturbance regime, characterized by high fire frequencies.",,,Forests; Succession; Control theory; Lichen - organism; Thickness (graph theory); Anytime algorithm; Occur (action); Unstable Medical Device Problem; Mosses; Geology; Word lists by frequency,,1/2/2006,,2,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,Landscape Ecology,2006,,No species information

It was likely introduced into southern Ontario at an international port on the Great Lakes in early 1970s, or possibly earlier in the 1960s. However, the exact location and date of introduction could not be precisely determined. The flea beetle has since dispersed northeastwards and reached Aylmer, north of Ottawa River, in Quebec, by 2003. This is about 375 km from Niagara Falls, where the oldest known specimens were collected in 1977. In 2009, various wild habitats and cultivated areas of Aylmer were surveyed. The host plants of the larvae could not be determined, but adults were swept from many plant species including various weeds and cultivated grasses: Alopecurus pratense (meadow foxtail), Dactylis glomerata (orchard-grass), Festuca rubra (red fescue-grass), and Poa pratensis (Kentucky blue-grass). Adults were also collected from flowers of several weeds: Aster sp. (undetermined species), Aster novae-angliae (New England aster), Ambrosia artemisiifolia (small ragweed), Echium vulgare (viper‚Äôs bugloss), Nasturtium officinale (water cress), Melilotus alba (white sweet-clover), Hypericum perforatum (common St. John‚Äôs-wort), Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife), Ranunculus acris (buttercup), and Solidago spp. (goldenrods).

https://doi.org/10.2166/WQRJ.2002.009,Follow-up Studies Addressing Questions Identified During Cycle 1 of the Adult Fish Survey of the Pulp and Paper EEM Program,"The Canadian federal government instituted an environment effects monitoring (EEM) program for the pulp and paper industry to ensure the long-term integrity of fish populations below the discharge of mill effluents. The program is cyclical in nature (every three to four years) and one of the components of the program is an adult fish survey which monitors wild fish health in the receiving environments. Cycle 1 reports were submitted in April of 1996, and the report for the James Maclaren Inc. mill at Thurso, Quebec, suggested some responses were evident in fish downstream of the mill discharge. However, the receiving environment was subject to inputs from other potential sources or confounding factors such as farm runoff, storm sewers, municipal discharges and upstream paper mills. A review of other Cycle 1 studies also identified a number of problems encountered during the adult fish surveys. At this time, Maclaren researchers and Environment Canada set up a collaborative research project as part of their Cycle 2 studies at the Thurso site. Objectives of the study included a comparison of Cycle 2 results to their Cycle 1 studies, an assessment of the potential for the use of forage fish in the EEM program as well as an evaluation of reference site variability in the required EEM fish parameters. Collections in 1997 confirmed an increased male yellow perch liver size downstream of the discharge, but could not confirm reproductive alterations in exposed fish. It was possible to obtain all of the required EEM fish parameters from a small forage fish species such as the johnny darter, which may reduce the influence of fish mobility and other confounding factors on fish responses at some sites. Reference site variability was not a contributing factor in evaluating fish responses to effluent sources at this site.",,,,,1/2/2002,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,site IDs,NA,Map,yellow perch,1997-1998,source publication text,1,no,60,no,presence only,,,,Water Quality Research Journal,,,

METHODS: We sampled 102 plots in the sugar maple (Acer saccharum)‚Äìbasswood (Tilia americana) subdomain, a deciduous type of forest in the northern temperate zone. Each plot was centred on a pine and browsing by deer, plot diversity and composition were measured. RESULTS: Total browsing and browsing on focal pines decreased with increasing values of diversity indices, but only in plots with high resource abundance. This result is in accordance with optimal foraging principles, as diversified plots have a lower concentration of preferred species. Total consumption did not vary with plot composition, but browsing on the focal pine decreased with increased abundance of Diervilla lonicera and Lonicera canadensis, abundant deciduous shrubs. This associational defence could protect vulnerable pines from deer browsing. CONCLUSION: While our study revealed a relationship between plant community diversity and winter browse use and selection by deer, it also highlighted the importance of resource abundance and community composition ‚Äì variables influencing the resource selection process.

https://doi.org/10.2307/3802888,Foraging ecology and use of drumming trees by three-toed woodpeckers,"Among boreal forest bird species, the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) is closely associated with old-growth forests (>120 years), and possibly the most negatively affected by long-term changes induced by commercial forestry in eastern Canada. Part of this conflict is related to the woodpecker's use of standing dead trees as nesting sites. Moreover, this woodpecker's foraging behavior and its choice of feeding and drumming substrates may increase its vulnerability in managed forests. We describe foraging behavior of three-toed woodpeckers, and characterize foraging and drumming trees used by this species in Quebec's black spruce (Picea mariana) forests. During summer (May-Jul) and mid-winter (Jan-Feb), birds of both sexes used a highly specialized feeding technique consistent with searching for bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). Snags were highly preferred over live trees as foraging substrates. Snags used for foraging had a greater diameter at breast height (dbh) and were less deteriorated than paired nearest available snags. When live trees were selected for foraging, they also had a greater dbh but were more deteriorated than nearest available live trees. Thus, only a limited number of trees had all characteristics preferred by foraging woodpeckers, probably as a result of the ecology of its phloem-boring prey. Snags also were highly preferred over live trees as drumming substrates. Drumming snags differed from paired nearest available snags by having a broken top, less bark cover, and a lower deterioration class, which probably provided better acoustic towers for territorial birds. Given the extensive use of snags with different characteristics for foraging and drumming by three-toed woodpeckers, models estimating snag requirements for this species based only on nesting requirements are probably of limited use to maintain populations in managed areas. Wildlife habitat management objectives that specifically require the maintenance and renewal of snags in early decaying stages found in old-growth forests are essential to the conservation of this woodpecker species in managed forests.",,,,,2002,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,no,NA,"site coordinates, administrative unit","Picoides tridactylus, and 4 tree species (Black spruce, Jack pine, Basam fir, White birch)",1997-1998,source publication text,3,no,100,source publication text,presence only,,,,The Journal of Wildlife Management,,,
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-009-5147-1,Frankia and Actinorhizal Plants,"The fifth meeting of scientists working with Frankia and actinorhizal plants was held at Montmorency Forest of Laval University in Quebec from August 6-8, 1984. Results of research presented at the meeting are included in this special volume of Plant and Soil. The understanding of actinorhizal systems continue to increase, though work and use shops and discussions at this and similar meetings make it evident that this important subject remains open for fruitful investigation at all levels. Some important 'firsts' were reported at this meeting. The first extensive survey of Frankiae and their host specificity ranges from Asia was presented. This is of significance since Asia is a center of diversity for many actinorhizal host plant genera. A report that proto plasts of Frankia have been produced and regenerated for the first time improves the possibility for genetic manipulation of Frankia. It is also important to note the first report herein of successful mass inoculation of actinorhizal plants commercially for stabilization and reclamation of disturbed soils around hydroelectric power projects in Quebec. This heralds the transfer of actinorhizal technology to private and public users. The bacterial genus Frankia is easily recognized both in vivo and in vitro, and isolation of this organism has become routine. But, as yet, there are not sufficient biochemical, morphological, or anatomical criteria for establishing species.""",,,Culture Media; Frankia; Peat; Germination; Suspensions; Alder plant; Projections and Predictions; Containers; Seedlings,,1985,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,1985,,

High mortality rates were observed during the first two years of the program (2014: 22.5% [7/31], 2015: 55.0% [22/40]). Mortalities for both years were associated with an unusually high occurrence of coelomitis consecutive to a confirmed (N = 11) or suspected (N = 4) gastro-duodenal perforation. Microscopically, the coelomitis consisted of serosal mesothesial cell hypertrophy, fibrinous to granulomatous inflammation, visceral adhesions, as well as the presence of bacterial colonies and alimentary particles. Marked dilation of the gastrointestinal tract associated with abundant food material, suggestive of a digestive impaction/ileus, was frequently observed with the coelomitis cases. During the second year of the program, the increase in the quantity of food offered and the substitution of freeze-dried Gammarus shrimp with larger and more abrasive sun-dried red shrimps (Solenocera melantho) were identified as potential risk factors for gastrointestinal perforations and could account for the increased mortality rate observed. Prospective dietary studies are warranted to establish optimal diet parameters in juvenile individuals from this species.",,,,,11/8/2017,,5,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bio One,2017,,
https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.13248,Genomic data support management of anadromous Arctic Char fisheries in Nunavik by highlighting neutral and putatively adaptive genetic variation,"Distinguishing neutral and adaptive genetic variation is one of the main challenges in investigating processes shaping population structure in the wild, and landscape genomics can help identify signatures of adaptation to contrasting environments. Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) is an anadromous salmonid and the most harvested fish species by Inuit people, including in Nunavik (Qu√©bec, Canada), one of the most recently deglaciated regions in the world. Unlike many other anadromous salmonids, Arctic Char occupy coastal habitats near their natal rivers during their short marine phase restricted to the summer ice‚Äêfree period. Our main objective was to document putatively neutral and adaptive genomic variation in anadromous Arctic Char populations from Nunavik and bordering regions to inform local fisheries management. We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to genotype 18,112 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 650 individuals from 23 sampling locations along >2000 km of coastline. Our results reveal a hierarchical genetic structure, whereby neighboring hydrographic systems harbor distinct populations grouped by major oceanographic basins: Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay, and Labrador Sea. We found genetic diversity and differentiation to be consistent both with the expected postglacial recolonization history and with patterns of isolation‚Äêby‚Äêdistance reflecting contemporary gene flow. Results from three gene‚Äìenvironment association methods supported the hypothesis of local adaptation to both freshwater and marine environments (strongest associations with sea surface and air temperatures during summer and salinity).

Weekly pitfall trapping in 1998 and 1999 in two vineyards in southern Quebec yielded over 4,600 spiders belonging to 97 species and 16 families. Spider assemblages (diversity and community composition) were similar between the two vineyards independent of environmental differences. However, some species-specific patterns were noted when the two vineyards were compared. High landscape diversity, including fallow fields and adjacent apple orchards, is hypothesized to account for a higher abundance of certain agrobiont species in one of the vineyards. Phenological data shows the most abundant linyphiid species, Tennesseellum formicum (Emerton), exhibits high phenotypic variation, and its multivoltine life cycles may be of adaptive importance for vineyards that are frequently disturbed. We also note several other species exhibiting period of peak activity in the spring [e.g., the wolf spiders Pardosa moesta Banks and Trochosa ruricola (De Geer)] or autumn [e.g., the funnel-web spider Agelenopsis potteri (Blackwall)]. Species turnover was high between sample dates, and data on activity and species richness of two guilds (web-building spiders and hunting spiders) indicate that many species that differ in foraging mode are active during all months of the growing season. The diverse ground-dwelling spider fauna in vineyards is therefore well positioned to prey on phyotophagous pests, and their populations should be conserved in these agroecosystems.",,,,,1/6/2005,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,article,article,site IDs,NA,site coordinates,97 spider species,1998-1999,source publication text,2,no,8,no,abundance,,,,Environmental Entomology,,,
https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-5713,Herd-level relationship between antimicrobial use and presence or absence of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bovine mastitis pathogens on Canadian dairy farms.,"Concurrent data on antimicrobial use (AMU) and resistance are needed to contain antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria. The present study examined a herd-level association between AMU and AMR in Escherichia coli (n=394) and Klebsiella species (n=139) isolated from bovine intramammary infections and mastitis cases on 89 dairy farms in 4 regions of Canada [Alberta, Ontario, Qu√©bec, and Maritime Provinces (Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick)]. Antimicrobial use data were collected using inventory of empty antimicrobial containers and antimicrobial drug use rate was calculated to quantify herd-level AMU. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using Sensititre National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) gram-negative MIC plate (Trek Diagnostic Systems Inc., Cleveland, OH). Isolates were classified as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant. Intermediate and resistant category isolates were combined to form an AMR category, and multivariable logistic regression models were built to determine herd-level odds of AMR to tetracycline, ampicillin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination, sulfisoxazole, streptomycin and kanamycin in E. coli isolates. In the case of Klebsiella species isolates, logistic regression models were built for tetracycline and sulfisoxazole; however, no associations between AMU and AMR in Klebsiella species were observed. Ampicillin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli isolates were associated with herds that used intramammarily administered cloxacillin, penicillin-novobiocin combination, and cephapirin used for dry cow therapy [odds ratios (OR)=26, 32, and 189, respectively], and intramammary ceftiofur administered for lactating cow therapy and systemically administered penicillin (OR=162 and 2.7, respectively). Use of systemically administered penicillin on a dairy farm was associated with tetracycline and streptomycin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli isolates (OR=5.6 and 2.8, respectively). Use of cephapirin and cloxacillin administered intramammarily for dry cow therapy was associated with increasing odds of having at least 1 kanamycin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli isolate at a farm (OR=8.7 and 9.3, respectively). Use of systemically administered tetracycline and ceftiofur was associated with cefoxitin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli (OR=0.13 and 0.16, respectively); however, the odds of a dairy herd having at least 1 cefoxitin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli isolate due to systemically administered ceftiofur increased with increasing average herd parity (OR=3.1). Association between herd-level AMU and AMR in bovine mastitis coliforms was observed for certain antimicrobials.

https://doi.org/10.25071/2292-4736%2F37681,"Hinterland's Who‚Äôs Who: Birding, Multiplicity, and Barn Owls","Full TextThe Barn Owl The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) is a medium-sized, tawny coloured owl that, with the exception of Antarctica, has worldwide distribution. Like most owls the Barn Owl is considered to be nocturnal. Like all owls, it is predatory bird. In the Barn Owl‚Äôs case, members of the species are said to enjoy (or specialize, in the biological parlance) in small ground mammals‚Äîrodents, for example. In Eastern North America, the majority of their diet would include Meadow Voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and Deer Mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Barn Owls strike a distinct-look with their lack of ear tufts (a misnomer of sorts as the tufts‚Äîthe ‚Äúhorns‚Äù of a Great Horned Owl, Bubo virginianus‚Äîare not ears and not associated with hearing at all) and their distinct heart-shaped facial disc (which is associated with hearing, but that‚Äôs another story for another time). As their common name suggests they can be found living in barns, on a nest made from the regurgitated un-digestible remains of those Meadow Voles and Deer Mice they hunt. Of course Barn Owls are not just limited to barns, but nest in silos, abandoned buildings and tree cavities too. Arguably, this should make their name ‚ÄúBarn, Silo, Abandoned Building & Tree Cavity Owl‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt really roll off the tongue in the same way. These attributes and distinguishing features are all things to keep in mind if you find yourself out birdwatching near a barn in Southern Ontario. During your explorations, while there are certain to be Rock Pigeons (Columba livia) fluttering about, if you happen to come across a Barn Owl in this setting, you should take notice. Seeing a Barn Owl in Southern Ontario (especially a living Barn Owl) is something to make special note of‚Äîit‚Äôs not a regular occurrence. Part of the significance of seeing a Barn Owl lies in its relative in-abundance. While individuals identified as Tyto alba enjoy a cosmopolitan reputation, Southern Ontario has been considered the northern range of the species (‚ÄúOntario Barn Own Recovery Project,‚Äù 2005) and it has been suggested that Barn Owls have always found, say, other places more to their liking. Because of this, the Barn Owl is a special bird in Canada: it is officially endangered, recognized by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) (‚ÄúOntario Barn Own Recovery Project,‚Äù 2005). It seems as though Barn Owls living in Ontario have had bad luck of late‚Äî of the ‚Äúhandful‚Äù (‚ÄúOntario Barn Own Recovery Project,‚Äù 2005 ¬∂ 4) that have been seen since 1999, two were roadkills (‚ÄúOntario Barn Own Recovery Project,‚Äù 2005) and no breeding pairs have been ‚Äúconfirmed.‚Äù The Barn Owl of February 27th 2006 If you are a serious birder in Ontario, with a computer and internet access, it is likely that you are aware of the electronic mailing list called Ontbirds. Ontbirds is presented by the self-proclaimed provincial birding association, the Ontario Field Ornithologists. The electronic mailing list (or listserv) is meant to be a clearing-house of bird sightings and directions for interested birders: you read about a bird you would like to see, get the directions and off you go on a (perhaps literal) wild goose chase. On average, four to seven sightings are posted daily. As might be expected, more posting occurs on the weekend, and more postings occur seasonally during spring and fall migration. Typical emails follow a standard form: the subject line contains the bird or birds seen and their location while the body of the email contains more specific information about the birds and precise directions to the location they might be found. While thorough, the information shared is, generally speaking, pretty uncontentious stuff. So, it was with interest that a seemingly normal post on February 28th, 2006 took on new dimensions: whispers of deception, accusation of fraud and, more interestingly for my work, questions of what is normal, known and natural all emerged. On February 28th, 2006, a simple posting appeared in mailboxes of subscribers outlining how a photograph had been taken of a Barn Owl and posted on a webbased photography site. A URL was given linking to the photograph. It was noted that the photographer had not reported seeing the bird on the Ontbirds listserv, but that there was a link to the location where the bird was seen. That same day, the moderator of the listserv posted reminding the subscribers that the Barn Owl was considered ‚Äúendangered‚Äù on breeding territory and that there were rules about posting about endangered birds on the listserv; all of the requirements that needed to be met prior to posting were created in order to reduce the likelihood that an observed bird would abandon a nest or breeding attempt. The following day, March 1st, a conversation had begun via the listserv. Another respondent was interested in knowing more details about the sighting and if the bird had been seen again. The next email later that day was from the photographer himself. In the email, he explained that though he did not remember exactly where he saw the bird, he used Google maps to locate the general location and road names. According to his directions, the Barn Owl was seen in Eastern Ontario, in the Ottawa region. As well, he shared the story of finding the owl, taking the photograph and watching the bird fly away from him. The author also stated that his initial reason for going out birding that day was to find Snowy Owls to photograph and that he had no luck in finding those birds that day. On March 2nd, another email arrived from another Ontbirds subscriber. In it, the author began to question the authenticity of the photograph. This email suggested that the owl‚Äôs feet have been ‚Äúdoctored,‚Äù as though something was removed after the photograph had been taken. The author reminded those reading that the Barn Owl is rare for Ontario and especially so where the photograph was taken‚Äîthe implication being that the bird is so rare that it most likely didn‚Äôt exist. A third email followed on March 2nd in which the author suggests that there is nothing in the photograph that appears unusual or doctored. The author offered another suggestion about the authenticity of the owl. He reminded us that there was a Barn Owl sighting in a different part of Ontario earlier in the winter and attributes the owl‚Äôs presence not to digital photographic magic, but to efforts undertaken on the part of humans to help the species recover. Yet, this claim to reality does not seem to be working. Later in the afternoon on March 2nd, a fourth email arrived that supports the initial hypothesis that the photograph has been doctored. The author shared that the bird looks like one he had seen at Parc Omega, a wildlife park in Qu√©bec, and provides a URL to a photograph of the Parc Omega Barn Owl. The pull of the network to make the photograph unauthentic, and in turn, the owl, continues to mount. In a fifth email, the author shared the contention that the fencepost the Barn Owl is pictured perching on was specially made for captive birds to land on. The author also suggested that given the lighting of the photograph and kind of weather that was observed on the day that the photograph was supposed to have been taken, the photograph could not be discounted as being genuine. This is where the conversation ends on Ontbirds. At 5:30 pm on March 2nd, the listserv co-ordinator posted a message that states that the current conversation on the photographed Barn Owl is inappropriate. The coordinator reminded readers that Ontbirds is not a discussion list and is for ‚Äúreporting birds period.‚Äù The closing line in the email reminds readers that not following the guidelines could result in the restriction or loss of being able to post to the listerv. This does not mean, however, that the conversation ended. In following the network thread to a website that catalogues rare birds from the Ottawa area, the sighting details for the Barn Owl seen on February 27th is prefaced with the words ‚ÄúLIKELY HOAX.‚Äù The page author outlines a litany of evidence that supports his claim that the image has been manipulated. The webpage author concludes his outline with the statement ‚Äúlet the viewer beware.‚Äù Enacting birds: reflection on the Barn Owl of February 27th I have spent some time thinking about the birders and the Barn Owl. I have read and reflected on the emails and the allegations. From this, themes have emerged concerning the construction of what is natural as well as insights into the creation of what Donna Haraway (2003) calls ""naturecultures."" Most importantly, this event, be it framed as authentic bird sighting or elaborate hoax, helps enact and make visible a topology of inter-species ethical relations between those who watch birds and the birds they watch. Networks Ontbirds operates within an established network of relations. People post their sightings to share with other interested birders. The process through which experiences are transcribed from embodied encounters to textual references is seemingly an invisible one. In this case, there were visible deviations from the established network. Within the birding community that posts to Ontbirds, the claim to have ""found"" a bird is an important one. In posts where the author is reporting a first-sighting and they did not find the bird themselves, the name of the bird finder (skilled, lucky or otherwise, as it is never suggested the kind of effort it took to come across the bird) is included. In this example, the finder did not make a submission to Ontbirds to report a rare bird. Rather, it seems like in this case, the original post came via an on-line gallery created by the finder that had the photograph and birding information on it. While never overtly stated, I believe that the authenticity of the Barn Owl was partially called into question due to the fact that the finder of the bird did not post his sighting to the listserv. Additionally, I find interesting to note that in the fin",,,"List of English terms of venery, by animal; Strigiformes; multiplicity",,16/11/2013,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,Tyto alba,,,,,,,,,,,UnderCurrents,2008,,

Hippodamia variegata was associated with English grain aphids and bird cherry-oat aphids in wheat, and with pea aphids in alfalfa in our survey. Previous surveys in other areas of North America recorded H. variegata from wheat and alfalfa (Ellis et al. 1999; Day and Tatman 2006). Potential prey in slender wheatgrass and the prairie was undetermined in our survey, but H. variegata has also been associated previously with plant species that occur in prairies (Ellis et al. 1999). The detection of H. variegata in South Dakota was unexpected this soon, as the nearest records of this species occurred approximately 400 km away in western Wisconsin in 2009 (Williams and Young 2009). The collections of 21 H. variegata during summer 2010 indicate that this species is now well established in Brookings County, South Dakota. In addition to weekly sampling of lady beetles in crop fields in Brookings County during the summer of 2010, other surveys for lady beetles in South Dakota did not find H. variegata at a nature preserve in Minnehaha County on 4 June or one in Beadle County on 31 July, suggesting a still limited local distribution. Additional surveys are needed to determine the extent to which H. variegata is present in South Dakota and to follow its geographic dispersion. Hippodamia variegata was released in Nebraska and several other Midwestern states, but not South Dakota, from 1987 to 1994 for intended biological control of the Russian wheat aphid (Flanders et al. 1991; Prokrym et al. 1998).

Since most knowledge of tree phyllosphere bacterial communities has been gathered in tropical forests, our goal was to characterize the community structure and assembly dynamics of phyllosphere epiphytic bacterial communities in temperate forests in Quebec, Canada. We targeted five dominant tree species: Acer saccharum, Acer rubrum, Betula papyrifera, Abies balsamea, and Picea glauca. We collected 180 samples of phyllosphere communities on these species at four natural forest sites, three times during the growing season.ResultsHost functional traits (i.e., wood density, leaf nitrogen content) and climate variables (summer mean temperature and precipitation) were strongly correlated with community structure. We highlight three key findings: (1) temperate tree species share a ‚Äúcore microbiome‚Äù; (2) significant evolutionary associations exist between groups of bacteria and host species; and (3) a greater part of the variation in phyllosphere bacterial community assembly is explained by host species identity (27¬†%) and species-site interaction (14¬†%), than by site (11¬†%) or time (1¬†%).ConclusionsWe demonstrated that host species identity is a stronger driver of temperate tree phyllosphere bacterial communities than site or time.

An ecologically and socially highly important northern terrestrial species that may be impacted by climate change is the caribou, Rangifer tarandus. We predicted the current and potential future occurrence of two migratory herds of caribou [Rivi√®re George herd (RG) and Rivi√®re‚Äêaux‚ÄêFeuilles (RAF) herd] under a Canadian General Circulation Model climate change scenario, across all seasons in the Qu√©bec‚ÄìLabrador peninsula, using climatic and habitat predictor variables. Argos satellite‚Äêtracking collars have been deployed on 213 caribou between 1988 and 2003 with locations recorded every 4‚Äì5 days. In addition, we assembled a database of climate (temperature, precipitation, snowfall, timing and length of growing season) and habitat data obtained from the SPOT VEGETATION satellite sensor. Logistic regression models indicated that both climatic and physical habitat variables were significant predictors of current migratory caribou occurrence. Migratory caribou appeared to prefer regions with higher snowfall and lichen availability in the fall and winter. In the summer, caribou preferred cooler areas likely corresponding to a lower prevalence of insects, and they avoided disturbed and recently burnt areas. Climate change projections using climate data predicted an increased range for the RAF herd and decreased range for the RG herd during 2040‚Äì2069, limiting the herds to northeastern regions of the Qu√©bec‚ÄìLabrador peninsula. Direct and indirect consequences of climate change on these migratory caribou herds possibly include alteration in habitat use, migration patterns, foraging behaviour, and demography, in addition to social and economic stress to arctic and subarctic native human populations.",,,Climate Change; Lichen - organism; Ecology; Labrador retriever; Demography; Impacted tooth; Residential gateway; Kerrison Predictor; Logistic regression; Habitat; Projections and Predictions; Reindeer; F-Spot; Ecosystem; General circulation model; Population; Terrestrial television,,1/10/2009,,5,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,article,article,administrative unit,NA,Map,"Rangifer

Some tree species, such as sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and ash (Fraxinus americana and/or F. pennsylvanica), have shown important increases since European colonization, while others have decreased sharply. In a site-by-site comparison, there are many instances where a species sold from a particular lot is completely absent from this lot today. Tamarack (Larix laricina) and black spruce (Picea mariana), two species that appear in the notary deeds, were completely eliminated from the studied lots. The apparent discrepancy between the predominance of lowlands in the landscape and the low presence in the notary deeds of tree species that prefer more humid conditions suggests that precolonial forests on the clay plain and lowlands were sparse or patchy or were composed of tree species of little stature or commercial value. For mesic sites, sales reported in the notary deeds suggest that the presettlement forest in the Haut-Saint-Laurent region corresponded to the maple-beech-birch forest type and that the most important change since European settlement is a loss or decrease in the abundance of American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis).

In particular, non‚Äìcrop areas and landscape diversity are often associated with a higher abundance and diversity of natural enemies in fields. Numerous studies focused on the influence of landscape structure on ground beetles, spiders and ladybeetles but few on other natural enemies or different functional groups. Thus, the objective of the present study was to determine the influence of landscape structure on the functional groups, i.e., active-searching predators, furtive predators and parasitoids of aphidophagous guilds. Natural enemies were sampled on milkweed infested with aphids, growing along the borders of ditches adjacent to cornfields. The sampling occurred weekly from June to September in 2006 and 2007, in the region of Lanaudiere (Quebec, Canada). The landscapes within a radius 200 and 500 m around each site were analyzed. The abundance, richness and species composition (based on functional groups) of natural enemies were related to landscape structure. The results indicated that landscape structure explained up to 21.6% of the variation in natural enemy assemblage and confirm the positive effects of non-crop areas and landscape diversity. A lower influence of landscape structure on species composition was observed (6.4 to 8.8%) and varied greatly among the functional groups. Coccinellidae and furtive predators were the group most influenced by landscape structure.

,Influence of zooplankton stoichiometry on nutrient sedimentation in a lake system,"We explored rates and stoichiometry (C : N : P ratios) of sinking particles in a temperate reservoir during a 2-yr period. Plankton was sampled weekly, and a sediment trap placed below the metalimnion collected sinking particles. There were no significant relationships between the stoichiometry of entrapped material and seston or zooplankton stoichiometry. However the differences in the entrapped C : P and N : P ratios between consecutive trap samplings were negatively correlated with the time variations of the zooplankton C : P and N : P ratios. Zooplankton C : P and N : P ratios were positively correlated with the percentage of copepod biomass in total zooplankton biomass .250 mm and negatively correlated with the percentage of cladocerans. Zooplankton biomass .250 mm reduced the fraction of N and P primary production lost to sinking (export ratio). The residuals of the N export ratio versus zooplankton biomass relationship were negatively correlated with the zooplankton N : P ratio, whereas there was a positive relationship with the residuals of the P export ratio relationship. These observations support the hypothesis that the regulation of elemental homeostasis in the herbivorous zooplankton consumers occurs at least partly at the assimilation/egestion level. Elements ingested in excess‚ÄîP for the herbivorous copepods and N for many cladocerans‚Äîare concentrated into sinking feces, whereas the deficient elements are captured into biomass. In lakes, the vertical flux of small particulate matter essentially comprises two components: the sinking of ungrazed phytoplankton cells (e.g., Reynolds et al. 1982) and the sinking of the feces or fecal pellets of planktonic primary consumers (Sarnelle 1999). Both types of particles will settle from the upper layer below the thermocline if their sinking rates are higher than their mineralization rates. A simple heuristic model (Elser et al. 1995) explicitly represents the processes involved (Eq. 1). Sx 5 rz,xexgPx 1 rxsx(1 2 g)Px (1) 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Acknowledgments We thank V√©ronique Jacquet and Rapha√´l Willame for field assistance, and we thank Dag Hessen, G√©rard Lacroix and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript. This work was supported by the National Fund for Scientific Research (Belgium). Sx is the sedimentation rate of the element x; rz,x is the fraction refractory to mineralization of the egested (ex), grazed (g) fraction of the production rate of element x (Px), and rx is the corresponding refractory fraction for the sinking (sx), ungrazed (1 2 g) fraction of the production rate of element x. For any given time interval, we can express the sedimentation rate as a fraction of elements incorporated by autotrophic activity during that interval. This fraction is referred to as the ‚Äò‚Äòexport ratio‚Äô‚Äô (ER; Eppley and Peterson 1979) and can be defined for any element x (ERx; Elser et al. 1995). 21 ER 5 (S P ) 5 r e g 1 r s (1 2 g) x x x z,x x x x ‚áî ER 5 r s 1 g(r e 2 r s ) (2) x x x z,x x x x This expression defines a relationship between export ratio and grazing intensity (g) in which ERx is a linear function of g with a y-intercept of rxsx and a slope of rz,xex 2 rxsx. The slope of this formula explicitly formalizes the influence of zooplankton on sedimentation of autotrophic production. Zooplankton, by its grazing activity, enhances the export ratio if the fraction of feces refractory to mineralization is 906 Darchambeau et al. Fig. 1. Location of the Esch-sur-S√ªre reservoir with morphometric and ecological summary information. The location of the sampling and sediment trap deployment station is indicated by S. higher than the refractory fraction of sinking phytoplankton cells (rz,xex . rxsx). However, in turn, zooplankton will decrease the export ratio if rz,xex , rxsx. The direction of the relationship between zooplankton (via its grazing) and sedimentation of particulate matter is thus dependent on (1) lake morphometry, which determines the fraction of phytoplankton that directly sediments (sx), (2) phytoplankton community characteristics (via rx and sx), and (3) zooplankton community characteristics (via rz,x and ex; Elser et al. 1995). The egested fraction of an element x (ex) is a function of the digestive ability of animals. Stoichiometric theory indicates that it could also be a function of consumer elemental needs (Sterner and Elser 2002). P-rich consumers, such as daphniids (Andersen and Hessen 1991; Hessen and Lyche 1991), have high demands of P from food; thus, the fraction of P egested from Daphnia must be lower than for genera with a lower P demand. In turn, copepods are rich in body nitrogen (N), and the fraction of N egested should be lower than for zooplankton species with a lower body N content. Moreover, apart from zooplankton stoichiometry, the fraction of feces refractory to mineralization (rz,x) also depends on their structure. Copepods surround their feces with a peritrophic membrane, which largely increases fecal cohesion and therefore the probability of sinking out of the epilimnion. So we can predict that copepods are likely to increase the export ratio of P and decrease the export ratio of N. However, for daphniid species, their effect on nutrient sedimentation will depend on the cohesion of their feces. If the feces sink before remineralization, we can predict a positive effect of daphniids on N sedimentation and a negative effect on P sedimentation. In this study, we monitored the elemental contents of seston, zooplankton, and settling particles in a mesoeutrophic lake during the annual period of stratification for 2 yr. We determined sinking of elements as a fraction of primary production to test the effects of zooplankton stoichiometry on vertical particulate-bound nutrient exports. Our results indicate that zooplankton biomass has a positive effect on N and P retention in the epilimnion and that zooplankton stoichiometry determines stoichiometry of settling particles. Materials and methods Field data acquisition‚ÄîThis field study was conducted in the Esch-sur-S√ªre reservoir in Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. A map and a summary of morphometric and ecological characteristics are provided in Fig. 1. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (1982) classification, the reservoir is considered a mesoeutrophic waterbody (Dohet and Hoffmann 1995). The survey was conducted at a station (maximum depth 30 m) located in the middle of the lake, representative of whole lake conditions (Thys et al. 1998). Seston and zooplankton were sampled weekly during the period of stratification (roughly from April to October) in 1999 and 2000. Lake stratification was determined weekly according to the temperature and oxygen vertical profiles obtained with a Hydrolab DS-4 multiprobe. The lower limit of the epilimnion was at 2‚Äì3 m in early May and continuously deepened until it was at 11‚Äì14 m in late September. The lower limit of the metalimnion started at 7‚Äì8 m in May and deepened to 17‚Äì20 m in September. Zooplankton was sampled with a 17-cm diameter, 250-mm mesh net towed vertically in the epilimnion. Six zooplankton samples for elemental analysis were collected on each sampling occasion and immediately filtered on preignited (12 h at 5008C), preweighted Whatman GF/C filters and directly frozen in dry ice. Epilimnetic zooplankton was additionally sampled with a 50-cm diameter, 50-mm mesh net to determine community composition and densities. Triplicate samples were collected and pooled to reduce heterogeneity in zooplankton horizontal distribution and sampling variability. The collected zooplankton was immediately narcotized in soda water, rinsed, and preserved within 4% formalin (Haney and Hall 1973). For seston analysis, a pooled sample was constituted on each sampling occasion from discrete samples (3 liters) collected with a Ruttner bottle and spaced every meter in the epilimnion. Another pool was constituted for the metalimnion. From each pool, one subsample of 1‚Äì2.5 liters were filtered on a Whatman GF/C filter and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen for pigment analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and six subsamples of 0.15‚Äì0.5 liters were filtered on preignited Whatman GF/C filters and directly frozen in dry ice for elemental analysis. A sediment trap was deployed at the top of the hypolimnion, and its deployment depth (8‚Äì21 m) was adjusted every 2 weeks according to the thermal and oxygen stratification of the water column. The trap consisted of one 15.4-cmdiameter, 133-cm-long polyvinyl chloride collection tube suspended from a floating pontoon. The trap was initially filled with GF/C-filtered lake water taken at the immersion depth of the trap. One liter of an inhibitory, high-density solution (180 mmol L21 HgCl2, 10% w/w NaCl) was added with the use of a small tube at the bottom of the trap. This solution inhibits the breakdown of entrapped material without catching swimmers (Lee et al. 1992; data not shown). The trap was recovered every 2 weeks, and the upper 4 liters were discarded. The remaining volume (;20 liters) was carefully poured into a large basin and gently mixed. The 907 Zooplankton and nutrient sedimentation water was filtered through a 250-mm Nitex screen, and six subsamples of particles ,250 mm were collected for elemental analysis on preignited Whatman GF/C filters. In addition, lake water was collected with a Ruttner bottle at the same depth as the trap immersion depth and submitted to the same procedures to correct trap contents for ambient par-",,,"Phytoplankton; Feces; Polyvinyl Chloride; Immersion (virtual reality); Sedimentation procedure; Heuristic; Elemental; Stratification; Zooplankton; Mercuric chloride; Plankton; Sodium Chloride; Physiologic calcification; Sampling (signal processing); Dry Ice; Morphometrics; Ephrin Type-B Receptor 1, human; Xor-encrypt-xor; Sediment; Oxygen; National Fund for Scientific Research; Homeostasis; Data acquisition; List of Code Lyoko episodes; Copepoda",,2005,,8,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,Zooplankton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"not distinction of species, only biomass data"

 Although the spatiotemporal dynamics of spruce budworm outbreaks have been intensively studied, forecasting outbreaks remains challenging. During outbreaks, budworm-linked warblers (Tennessee, Cape May, and bay-breasted warbler) show a strong positive response to increases in spruce budworm, but little is known about the relative timing of these responses.
 
 
 We hypothesized that these warblers could be used as sentinels of future defoliation of budworm host trees. We examined the timing and magnitude of the relationships between defoliation by spruce budworm and changes in the probability of presence of warblers to determine whether they responded to budworm infestation before local defoliation being observed by standard detection methods.
 
 
 We modelled this relationship using large-scale point count surveys of songbirds and maps of cumulative time-lagged defoliation over multiple spatial scales (2‚Äì30¬†km radius around sampling points) in Quebec, Canada.
 
 
 All three warbler species responded positively to defoliation at each spatial scale considered, but the timing of their response differed. Maximum probability of presence of Tennessee and Cape May warbler coincided with observations of local defoliation, or provided a one year warning, making them of little use to guide early interventions. In contrast, the probability of presence of bay-breasted warbler consistently increased 3‚Äì4¬†years before defoliation was detectable.
 
 
 Early detection is a critical step in the management of spruce budworm outbreaks and rapid increases in the probability of presence of bay-breasted warbler could be used to identify future epicenters and target ground-based local sampling of spruce budworm.

How does the abundance or richness of one vegetation layer affect the abundance or richness of the other? Location: Boreal mixed-wood forests of Ontario and Quebec, Canada. Methods: We sampled fire-origin stands of varying overstorey composition from broad-leaf-dominated to mixed to conifer-dominated stands on mesic sites in Ontario and subhydric sites in Quebec. Overstorey tree species composition and understorey shrub, herb, bryophyte and lichen species cover and richness were estimated within 400-m 2 circular plots. In addition, soil nutrients, coarse woody debris and light conditions were measured. Overstorey composition was expressed as the percentage basal area of broad-leaf tree species. Path analysis was used to examine interactions among the forest layers. Results: Overstorey broad-leaf composition had positive effects on shrub and herb layer cover and herb layer richness, and negative effects on bryophyte and lichen species cover and richness. Shrub layer cover had no effect on herb layer cover, but shrub layer richness had a positive effect on herb layer richness. Herb layer cover and richness had negative effects on bryophyte species cover and richness. Bryophyte cover had no effect on lichen cover, but its richness was positively related to lichen richness. In both regions, soil pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and cation exchange capacity of the forest floor were positively correlated with overstorey broad-leaf composition and with shrub layer cover and herb layer cover. Conclusions: Increasing overstorey broad-leaf composition, through its influence on soil nutrients, promotes shrub and herb layer species, but limits bryophyte and lichen species. In the overstorey-controlled understorey resource environment, cover and richness of shrub and herb layers increase with resource availability, whereas bryophytes and lichens show positive associations with abundance of coarse woody debris.",,,,,1/5/2013,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,plant communities,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of Vegetation Science,2012,,

,Laboratory diagnosis of rabies in Canada for calendar year 2006.,"The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), with laboratories in Ottawa, Ontario (Centre of Expertise for Rabies) and Lethbridge, Alberta, conducts rabies testing in Canada on all suspect rabid animals where there was human or domestic animal contact and for all human suspect cases (diagnostic submissions). In addition, individual provinces may contract with the CFIA to provide diagnostic support for intensified surveillance programs (survey samples). The majority of all submissions are tested by the fluorescent antibody test (FAT) (1), the method recommended by the World Health Organization for the routine diagnosis of rabies (2). In addition, diagnostic submissions where there was documented human contact and a negative FAT are subject to a second, confirmatory test, the rabies tissue culture inoculation test (RTCIT). Although not preferred as a method for routine rabies diagnosis, formalin-fixed samples can be tested by using an avidin-biotin complex (ABC) immunohistochemistry test (3). 
 
In 2006, 7201 diagnostic submissions were received for testing. An additional 1872 survey samples were tested as part of surveillance programs carried out by the provinces of Ontario and Quebec (Table 1). A small proportion of the diagnostic submissions were unfit for testing by the FAT (n = 86) or ABC (n = 1). Of the submissions fit for testing, 229 were positive for rabies virus antigen by the FAT: 227 from the diagnostic submissions and 2 from the Quebec survey. While these data represent a decrease in the total number of annual rabies cases compared to each of the previous 5 y, the percent of positive submissions has not changed greatly over this time (2002 ‚Äî 4.0%, 2003 ‚Äî 3.2%, 2004 ‚Äî 3.4%, 2005 ‚Äî 3.6%, 2006 ‚Äî 3.2%). Diagnostic submissions tested by ABC (n = 6) or RTCIT (n = 5363) in 2006 were all negative for rabies.

The majority of diagnostic submissions originated from the provinces of Ontario and Quebec (76.3%), followed by the Western provinces (19.3%), the Atlantic provinces (3.6%), and the Northern territories (0.7%). The largest numbers of positive cases originated from Ontario (n = 82), Manitoba (n = 65), and Saskatchewan (n = 33). Although Quebec submitted the 2nd largest number of submissions, only 0.6% were positive for rabies, in contrast with the results for Ontario (2.4%), Manitoba (12.7%), and Saskatchewan (11%). There were no rabies cases in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, or the Yukon. However, submission numbers from these regions were low ‚Äî fewer than 50 for 4 of the 5 regions. As such, it is probable that the true rabies burden in these regions is not reflected in these statistics. In particular, there were only 3 submissions from the Yukon. This article and Blanton et al (4) suggest that, given the prevalence of rabies in the Northwest Territories and Alaska in 2006, it is likely that there is rabies in the Yukon. 
 
The species that tested positive for each province and territory are listed in Table 2. Of these, 45.4% were wild carnivora (striped skunks [Mephitis mephitis] were most abundant), 31.4% were bats (big brown bats [Eptesicus fuscus] were most abundant), and 23.1% were domestic animals (cattle [Bos taurus] were most abundant). As observed in previous years, there was a regional distribution with respect to the species of the positive cases. Not unexpectedly, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut did not have any bat rabies, but did record cases in arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), as well as in dogs (Canis domesticus). Positive bats were found in all provinces with rabies cases. Species affected included big brown, little brown (Myotis lucifugus), silver-haired (Lasionycteris noctivagans), hoary (Lasiurus cinerus), California (M. californicus), and long-eared (M. evotis) bats. All rabies cases from British Columbia and Alberta were in bats, with the exception of 1 rabid cat (Felis domesticus) found in Alberta. Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec all had cases in wildlife other than bats, as well as in domestic animals, including cats, dogs, cattle, horses (Equus caballus), and 1 sheep (Ovis aries). In addition to the animal submissions, 5 suspect human rabies cases were tested by FAT, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, or both; all tests were negative for rabies.

Submissions that tested positive for rabies were identified by antigenic typing using panels of monoclonal antibodies that distinguish between the common variants known to circulate in Canada (5,6). In general, bats that tested positive for rabies carried the variants commonly associated with the given bat species. Two variants continue to circulate in skunks found in Canada. In Saskatchewan and Manitoba this is the Western skunk virus variant and in Ontario this is the Arctic variant normally associated with arctic and red foxes. While the Arctic variant has been controlled in red foxes in Ontario by using the ERA oral vaccine (7), the striped skunk, which remains refractory to immunization with ERA, has become a reservoir of this variant in the south-western area of the province, centered in Wellington and Grey counties (8). The impact of the epizootic of rabies in skunks in Ontario is clear: In 2006 all of the cases of rabies in domestic animals in this province (n = 14), as well as the cases in red fox and raccoon (Procyon lotor) (n = 3), were from this region, and were all due to the Arctic variant. Likewise, in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the spillover of rabies into domestic animals was due to infection caused by the Western skunk variant. Two cases of spillover of rabies from bats were found in 2006; the first was a cat in Alberta that was infected with a variant associated with little brown bats, the second was a skunk from Quebec infected with a variant associated with big brown bats. Not surprisingly, the dogs and foxes that tested positive from the Northwest Territories and Nunavut and 2 dogs from northern Quebec had the Arctic variant. 
 
In May 2006, a raccoon, found in southern Quebec near the Vermont border, tested positive for rabies virus that was typed as the mid-Atlantic raccoon variant. This represented a new incursion of this variant into Canada since the last reported case of raccoon-variant rabies was in eastern Ontario in September 2005. A subsequent surveillance program initiated by the Quebec government identified an additional 2 raccoons harbouring the mid-Atlantic raccoon variant in June. Another raccoon that tested positive for rabies (also mid-Atlantic raccoon variant) was reported in November. This epizootic has grown to more than 60 cases identified in 2007, including raccoons, skunks, and 1 red fox, infected with the raccoon-variant rabies virus. 
 
The rate of positive submissions was consistently higher for cases involving no human contact versus those involving human contact as reported by the veterinary investigator (Table 3). This was true for all the species categories (bats, other wildlife, domestic animals). Of the 229 positive submissions in 2006, more than half (n = 118) originated from animals where there was no known human contact, despite the fact that 76% of the diagnostic submissions were animals reported to have had human contact. Thirty-eight percent of the positive results with no human contact (45/118) also did not have any reported domestic animal contact. In addition, the positive specimens with no human contact originated from 96 counties in Canada, while those with a history of human exposure represented only 70 counties. With respect to understanding rabies epidemiology in Canada, there is substantial benefit to be gained from testing animals that are exhibiting clinical symptoms consistent with rabies, regardless of whether they pose a direct health risk to humans or domestic animals. A true picture of the rabies burden, obtained by comprehensive testing, is necessary for efficacious and cost-effective control measures to be implemented.

Experimental studies were designed to reproduce treatment plant and distribution system conditions (chlorine dose, water temperature, pH and water residence time). Differences in halogenated DBPs in the two distribution systems under study were significant and comparable to those observed in experimental laboratory studies. For the waters of both utilities, chlorination studies better reproduced the occurrence of halogenated DBPs in points of the distribution system located near the treatment plant (low residence time of water) than in other points. Multivariate regression models for THMs, HAAs and their species were developed using the data from experimental studies in order to predict halogenated DBP levels measured in the distribution system. Models were all statistically significant, but showed low ability to predict full-scale halogenated DBPs, particularly in points located at distribution system extremities. Specifically, experimental chlorination-based models are not able to simulate the decrease of HAA levels. Results of this research suggest that the use of experimental data to predict halogenated DBP levels in full-scale distribution systems ‚Äì for operational, regulatory and epidemiological purposes ‚Äì must be done with caution.",,,"Chlorine; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated; Hydroxyquinolines; Water; Trihalomethanes; Limb structure; Heterocyclic Amines",,1/11/2005,,5,semantic_scholar,,,,non biological,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,low responses of understory plants of maple-dominated forests to white-tailed eer experimental exclusion m√©lie Collarda,"We examined the response of understory plants in mature maple-dominated forests of southern Qu√©bec, Canada, following about 30 years of high deer densities, using a deer exclosure experiment. An exclosure and a paired control of 625 m2 each were established on six sites in 1998. An exclosure and a paired control of 16 m2 were added at each of the same sites in 2003 but under a recent canopy gap to determine if light could enhance plant responses. We measured plant richness and abundance, and aboveground biomass of different plant groups for 8 years in the understory plots and for 3 years in the canopy gaps. Four herbaceous species were also monitored individually in the same plots. No significant differences between treatments were found in plots under forest cover, except for lateral obstruction at 0‚Äì50 cm height which was higher in the exclosures. Under canopy gaps, however, tree seedling and total plant abundance were higher in deer exclosures than in control plots. Trillium erectum recovered partially as individuals were taller, had larger leaves and more frequently produced a flower or a fruit in the absence of deer browsing under forest cover. To a lesser extent, Erythronium americanum and Maianthemum canadense also exhibited signs of recovery but were still at the single-leaf stage after 8 years of recovery. In general, the different plant groups exhibited little recovery following deer exclusion, possibly because of the low light levels that prevailed in the understory of undisturbed maple-dominated forests. The higher latitude of the present study could also contribute to the slow recovery rates of the different groups of plants compared to studies conducted in northeastern USA. Variability among sites and years had an effect on detection of statistically significant differences. Trends are however appearing over time, suggesting that many understory plants are recovering very slowly following deer exclusion.

The main objective of this paper is to show that a well-managed lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens population can support a high and sustainable commercial catch, even in the Great Lakes drainage where the species has nowadays become rare. In a 350-km long un-fragmented stretch of the lower St Lawrence River located between Montreal and downstream Quebec City, with declared annual catches of 150¬†tonnes, the lake sturgeon population was considered overexploited by a governmental scientific committee in 1987 on the basis of high annual mortality rates (17‚Äì25% for age groups 14‚Äì31), unbalanced age structure, deficit of reproductive potential and commercial catch yields well over 1.5¬†kg¬†ka‚àí1. A first management plan implemented in 1987 failed to reduce the catch and provide more protection to the spawning stock. During the 1990s, the declared catch of the 76 commercial fishermen kept increasing over 200¬†tonnes. The age at the recruitment of the 20-cm-mesh gill-nets shifted towards older fish, indicating a decrease in the numbers of younger fish. In the population, sub-adult abundance decreased by 60%, as well as the year-class strength and the abundance of the females on the largest known spawning ground. In 2000, a stronger management plan was then enforced in order to adapt the total catch to the potential of the resource. The commercial catch was reduced by 60% in 3¬†years and an individual code-bar plastic tag and a code-bar weight declaration coupon were established to control its application. The fishing season was also shortened. Ten years later, we are confident in maintaining the actual commercial fishery because the commercial catch is now much lower (80¬†tonnes) and is more effectively controlled, the abundance of juvenile lake sturgeon increased throughout the St Lawrence River and the regular yearly production of cohorts has been demonstrated. Restrictive management measures, close supervision of landings combined with periodic monitoring of the population are key elements in managing this long-lived species. We also emphasize the importance of preventing any further fragmentation of this portion of 350¬†km of fluvial habitat as well as to maintain habitat quality to ensure the sustainability of this fishery.",,,,,1/4/2011,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,article,article,"administrative unit, geographic feature",NA,"Map, administrative unit, geographic feature",Acipenser fulvescens,1995-2008,source publication text,13,no,no,NA,abundance,,,,Journal of Applied Ichthyology,,,

https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-651074%2Fv1,"Mid-term Impacts of Silvicultural Treatments on Soils and Understory Plant Diversity in Temperate Hardwood Forests of Quebec, Canada.","
 Background: Short-term effects of silvicultural treatments on soil properties and understory vegetation in temperate hardwood forests are well documented, but few studies have examined longer term effects of treatment intensity. We hypothesized that short-term effects of silvicultural treatments on understory plant diversity do persist over the medium-term (20 years after treatment); the magnitude of these effects would be proportional to the intensity of canopy and soil disturbance.Methods: Soil properties (pH, total C and N, extractable P, exchangeable bases) and understory community diversity indices were measured in six experimental sites along a longitudinal gradient that covered different climatic and edaphic conditions in the yellow birch-sugar maple bioclimate domain. Reference condition, i.e. control forest with no anthropogenic disturbance for at least 80 years (CON) were compared to twenty years old regeneration treaments representing a gradient of canopy and soil disturbance intensity: single-tree selection cuts (SIN); group-selection cuts (GRP); and group-selection cuts with scarification (GRPS). Results: Geographic location of sites explained more variation in soil properties and community composition than did treatments. Species richness in both group-selection treatments was higher than that in CON forests. However, understory plant equitability and beta diversity among sites in GRP and GRPS were lower than in SIN and CON forests. More intense treatments (GRP and GRPS) increased the relative occurrence of vegetatively reproducing heliophilic plants, a trait syndrome associated with adaptations to disturbed environments. These treatments also contributed to the medium-term persistence of recalcitrant competitor species (e.g., Rubus idaeus, Prunus pensylvanica) whereas soil scarification appears to have negative sustained effects on species known to be sensitive to regeneration treatments (e.g. Monotropa uniflora, Dryopteris spinulosa).Conclusion: Of the treatments studied, single-tree selection cutting appears to be the most appropriate silvicultural treatment for maintaining soil functions and heterogeneous understory plant communities with compositions and structures similar to natural forests, while more intense treatments rather maintain and expand species that are better adapted to a wider range of environmental conditions, including open environments.",,,,,29/6/2021,,5,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research Square,2021,,
,Modelling individual tree mortality: Tests using the growth efficiency concept with black spruce stands,"There exists no universal method to model individual tree mortality due to the competition between individual trees. Simulation models often pursue different goals, ranging from the prediction of growth and yield to testing of theories of forest dynamics. Hawkes (2000) recently pointed out that one of the most promising approaches to predict tree mortality consists of using the growth efficiency (E) concept. E is defined as stem growth per unit of projected leaf area (leaf area index, LAI) and is therefore a measure of growth relative to the part of the plant responsible for carbon capture, and thus indicating variations in productive capacity. E has been suggested as a variable that can be interpreted from a biological and physiological point of view. E has the following advantages in simulating mortality (Hawkes 2000): 1) Low E is associated with a woody plant‚Äôs inability to accumulate reserves and is a sign of a stressed tree. 2) As a relative measure, E is not site-specific; 3) E is not species-specific because in conditions of scarce resources the plant with the lower E will suffer more whatever the species. 4) E acclimatises to climate change so mortality will not necessarily be catastrophic under different climate scenarios. 5) E tends to decline with time, age and size, representing declining vigour without having to define any age or size parameters. 6) E can be higher in trees under competitive stress. The objective of this study was to test and apply the concept of growth efficiency in a model aimed at predicting individual tree mortality in Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) dominated stands located in Quebec (Mailly et al. 2003). To achieve this goal 4 different locations were selected north of Quebec City in the R√©serve Faunique des Laurentides. Within each location, two different sites were sampled (rich and poor) for a total of 8 sampling units. In each sampling unit, a pair of dominant, codominant, intermediate and suppressed trees were harvested using standard stem analysis and tree architecture techniques. In each pair, one tree with a live crown ratio > 70% and one with a live crown ratio < 30% were selected. The poster will show the upcoming results from this study in which the growth efficiency of each tree was reconstructed and inferences about the likelihood of mortality were made through a modelling approach.",,,Sampling (signal processing); Picea; Trees (plant); Sampling - Surgical action; Projections and Predictions; Crown group; Simulation,,2004,,8,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://doi.org/10.3390/f11010003,Modelling Post-Disturbance Successional Dynamics of the Canadian Boreal Mixedwoods,"Natural disturbances, such as fire and insect outbreaks, play important roles in natural forest dynamics, which are characterized over long time scales by changes in stand composition and structure. Individual-based forest simulators could help explain and predict the response of forest ecosystems to different disturbances, silvicultural treatments, or environmental stressors. This study evaluated the ability of the SORTIE-ND simulator to reproduce post-disturbance dynamics of the boreal mixedwoods of eastern Canada. In 1991 and 2009, we sampled all trees (including seedlings and saplings) in 431 (256 m2) plots located in the Lake Duparquet Research and Teaching Forest (western Quebec). These plots were distributed in stands originating from seven wildfires that occurred between 1760 and 1944, and which represented a chronosequence of post-disturbance stand development. We used the 1991 inventory data to parameterize the model, and simulated short- to long-term natural dynamics of post-fire stands in both the absence and presence of a spruce budworm outbreak. We compared short-term simulated stand composition and structure with those observed in 2009 using a chronosequence approach. The model successfully generated the composition and structure of empirical observations. In long-term simulations, species dominance of old-growth forests was not accurately estimated, due to possible differences in stand compositions following wildfires and to differences in stand disturbance histories. Mid- to long-term simulations showed that the secondary disturbance incurred by spruce budworm did not cause substantial changes in early successional stages while setting back the successional dynamics of middle-aged stands and accelerating the dominance of white cedar in late-successional post-fire stands. We conclude that constructing a model with appropriate information regarding stand composition and disturbance history considerably increases the strength and accuracy of the model to reproduce the natural dynamics of post-disturbance boreal mixedwoods.",,,,,18/12/2019,,2,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,no,NA,range coordinates,"balsam fir, white birch, white spruce, trembling aspen, eastern white cedar ",1991-2009,source publication text,2,no,no,NA,"presence only, abundance",,,,Forests,,,
https://doi.org/10.1139/B05-012,Molecular markers indicate that the narrow Qu√©bec endemics Rosa rousseauiorum and Rosa williamsii are synonymous with the widespread Rosa blanda,"Rosa rousseauiorum Boivin and Rosa williamsii Fern. are two rare roses in eastern Quebec, whose taxo- nomic status is controversial. Morphological characters alone do not clearly differentiate these two taxa from each other or from the morphologically variable and widespread Rosa blanda Ait. We evaluated the taxonomic status of these two taxa, and of two other R. blanda segregates, Rosa subblanda Rydb. and Rosa johannensis Fern., through an analysis of RAPD, ISSR, and AFLP markers. We surveyed 86 individuals from 36 populations in eastern North Amer- ica. Despite a high degree of polymorphism, principal coordinate analyses and the weighted pair group method with arithmetic averaging suggest no clustering of individuals that correspond to taxonomic boundaries. However, the closely related Rosa palustris Marsh. is clearly differentiated from the R. blanda s.l. taxa. When populations of R. blanda west of Quebec are included, the principal coordinate analyses and Mantel tests indicate the presence of a significant east- west geographic gradient. Analyses of molecular variation suggest that most of the observed variation occurs within taxa, rather than among taxa. A weak inter-taxon variation is nonetheless significant for RAPD and ISSR data, and a weak pattern dependent on geographical location is evident within the province of Quebec. In accordance with studies based on morphological characters, molecular data indicate that R. rousseauiorum and R. williamsii should not be con- sidered as species distinct from R. blanda. Resume : Rosa rousseauiorum Boivin et Rosa williamsii Fern. sont deux rosiers rares, indigenes a l'est du Quebec dont le statut taxonomique est controverse. Ils sont affilies au Rosa blanda Ait. s.l. chez lequel un grand polymor- phisme morphologique est observe. Une etude moleculaire qui vise a verifier le statut taxonomique de ces deux taxons, ainsi que le statut de Rosa subblanda Rydb. et Rosa johannensis Fern., deux autres especes segregees de R. blanda s.l., a ete realisee. Nous presentons des analyses de marqueurs RAPD, ISSR et AFLP sur 86 individus provenant de 36 populations de l'est de l'Amerique du Nord. Malgre un haut taux de polymorphisme intraspecifique, les analyses de groupement et d'ordination en espace reduit ne demontrent aucun regroupement correspondant aux especes traditionnel- lement definies a l'interieur de R. blanda s.l. Neanmoins, Rosa palustris Marsh., une espece proche-parente servant de groupe temoin, est clairement distincte de R. blanda s.l. Lorsque des populations de l'ouest de l'aire de repartition de R. blanda sont incluses, un gradient est-ouest est observe et appuye par l'ordination en espace reduit et des tests de Mantel. Les analyses de variance moleculaire suggerent que la majorite de la variabilite genetique observee se trouve a l'interieur des taxa plutot qu'entre taxa. La faible variabilite inter-taxon est neanmoins significative pour les RAPD et les ISSR et un patron geographique faible regroupant les populations d'une meme region est aussi observable au Que- bec. Rosa rousseauiorum et R. williamsii, difficilement differencies a l'aide des caracteres morphologiques, ne peuvent par les analyses moleculaires etre distingues ni entre elles ni des autres especes du complexe du R. blanda au Quebec.

Many mosquito species are rarely collected in Canada and their history is poorly understood; thus assessing their potential role as vectors for pathogenesis is difficult. Mosquitoes were collected from four trapping sites in Quebec Province, Canada, from June to September during 2018 and 2019 using BG sentinel traps. From all morphologically identified female mosquitoes, at least one specimen was selected for identification confirmation using the DNA-barcoding technique. Sequences were subjected to alignment and a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree was created using Geneious software. In total, 2,752 female mosquitoes belonging to 20 species over five genera: including Aedes (Ae.), Anopheles (An.), Culex (Cx.), Culiseta (Cu.), Coquillettidia (Cq.) were collected. The predominant mosquito was found to be Ae. cinereus. The highest number of mosquito species was captured in July, followed by August, September, and then June. Five genera were characterized by a distinctive set of cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences that formed well-supported clusters in the NJ-tree. The presence of Ae. japonicus in Quebec provides an initial look at the distribution of mosquito species in eastern Canada, which may put Canadians at risk of a wider range of arboviruses.",,,confirmation - ResponseLevel; Culiseta; DNA End-Joining Repair; Projections and Predictions; Culicidae; CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE; Aedes <genus>; Coquillettidia,,13/2/2020,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of Medical Entomology,2020,,

Molecular analysis of the allopatric populations indicated a small amount of interspecific gene leakage with no asymmetric directionality to introgression. A high occurrence of hybrid/introgressant individuals was observed within sympatric populations, suggesting weak reproductive isolation.

Nestedness of species assemblages is frequent and may result from selective extinction or frequent colonization in insular habitats. It may also be created by a nested distribution of habitats among islands or by sampling bias. We sampled 67 isolated peatlands (7‚Äì843‚Äâha) in southern Quebec, Canada, to measure nestedness of bird species assemblages among peatlands and assess the habitat nestedness hypothesis. Species and microhabitat assemblages were both strongly nested among peatlands. Whether sites were ranked by species richness, microhabitat richness or peatland area had no effect on nestedness. However, microhabitat nestedness was significantly reduced when sites were sorted by area rather than by microhabitat richness. As expected, if bird-microhabitat associations are responsible for the nested pattern of distribution, we found a positive correlation between the contributions of bird species and microhabitats to individual site nestedness. Nevertheless, microhabitat assemblages were significantly less nested than bird species assemblages, possibly because of frequent recolonization by birds or uneven sampling among sites.",,,Mental association; Aves,,1/3/1999,,7,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,site IDs,NA,geographic feature,c. 20 bird species,no,NA,<1,source publication text,no,NA,presence only,,,,Oecologia,,,temporal_duration: 1 month
,New and noteworthy records of Orthoptera from Maritime Canada,"Although Vickery and Kevan (1985) provided an exhaustive synopsis of the grasshoppers, crickets and related insects of Canada, some of which can have significant negative economic impact, reference to their distribution maps suggests that Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick in particular, have been poorly collected for these taxa. More recently, Scudder and Vickery (2010) reviewed the Orthoptera of the Maritime region, noting the need for increased monitoring of these insects to document shifting populations and distribution in response to anticipated changes in climate. They provide a list of 21 species that occur in neighbouring Maine and Quebec, some or all of which may be anticipated to occur in the Maritime Provinces, may already be present, or may be spreading in the region. Here we briefly report on six species of Orthoptera recently encountered in New Brunswick or on Prince Edward Island, several for the first time.

Three individuals harbored bat bugs which were subsequently identified as Cimex adjunctus Barber 1939. This is the first record of this species from C. rafinesquii. In August 2013, 10 C. rafinesquii were collected from a maternity colony in Drew County in southeastern Arkansas. Four of the bats harbored bat bugs, which were identified as C. adjunctus. This is the first record of this bat bug from Arkansas. A summary of previous state and host records of the insect is provided, as is a summary of parasite records from C. rafinesquii. Results and Discussion Rafinesque‚Äôs big eared bat (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) roosts in abandoned buildings, caves, hollow trees, and under bridges across the southeastern United States (Jones 1977, Trousdale and Beckett 2004). This bat commonly forms colonies ranging in number from a few individuals to 100 or more. On 28 June 2009, 14 C. rafinesquii were handcollected from an abandoned house near Shepherd, San Jacinto County, Texas. A maternity colony of C. rafinesquii numbering >50 individuals occupied this roost each year from 2005-2009 and in 2012 (surveys were not conducted in other years). Three Cimex adjunctus Barber 1939 were found on the torso and uropatagium of 3 lactating adult female bats. No external parasites were noted on 8 additional adult females or 3 juvenile males also captured at the same location and time. Bat bugs were preserved in ethanol and deposited in the Gibson Entomarium in the Biology Department at Stephen F. Austin State University. This is the first record of C. adjunctus from Rafinesque‚Äôs big-eared bat. A maternity colony of over 100 individuals of C. rafinesquii roosts in the Taylor House, an abandoned antebellum building located at the edge of an agricultural field adjacent to Bayou Bartholomew in Drew County, Arkansas. On August 2, 2013, 10 individuals were captured with a hand net. All of the captured bats were females; 3 were lactating. Four of the bats harbored bat bugs, which were collected and preserved in 95% ethanol. All bats were released unharmed at the point of capture. The preserved bat bugs were sent to the Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology at Auburn University, Alabama, where they were identified as Cimex adjunctus. Specimens were deposited in the insect collection of the Museum of Natural History at Auburn. This represents the first record of C. adjunctus from Arkansas. Cimex adjunctus is found over most of the eastern United States and southeastern Canada and has been recorded as far west as Colorado (Usinger 1966). It has previously been reported from Eptesicus fuscus in Illinois, Indiana (Webster and Whitaker 2005), Missouri (Bowles et al. 2013), Kansas (Sparks et al. 2003), Michigan (Dood and Kurta 1982), Alabama (Durden et al. 1992), Kentucky, Colorado, Georgia, and Florida (Usinger 1966), from Lasionycteris noctivagans in Nebraska (Usinger 1966) and South Dakota (Swier 2003), and from Nycticeus humeralis in Kansas (Sparks et al. 2003), Missouri (Bowles et al. 2013), Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Alabama, Florida, and Texas (Usinger 1966). This bat bug is known from Myotis californicus in Colorado (Usinger 1966), from Myotis lucifigus in Missouri (Palmer and Gunier 1975), Michigan (Dood and Kurta 1988), Pennsylvania (Dick et al. 2003), Tennessee (Reeves et al. 2007), West Virginia (Wilson 1943), Colorado, Indiana, Virginia, 149 Journal of the Arkansas Academy of Science, Vol. 68 [2014], Art. 26 Published by Arkansas Academy of Science, 2014 M.E.

https://doi.org/10.5751/ace-01979-160226,No common pesticides detected in snow buntings utilizing a farmland landscape in eastern Qu√©bec,"Many species of migratory birds are declining worldwide, including throughout North America. Some of the most cited causes of decline are linked to climate change, urbanization, and growth in agriculture. Across eastern Canada, a number of insecticides and herbicides are commonly sprayed before and during the grain growing season to control pests and foliage competitors. During wintering and migration, a declining Arctic-breeding songbird, the snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis), utilizes open farmlands of southern Canada; therefore, this could be a period when the species is most exposed to these pesticides. We tested snow bunting tissues (blood and liver) for the 4 pesticides most commonly used in grain agriculture in Canada: atrazine, chlothianidin, imidacloprid, and glyphosate, as well as a glyphosate derivative (aminomethylphosphic acid, AMPA). Although this species is thought to forage in grain fields during autumn through spring, we found no detectable traces of any of the five substances. Wintering buntings may either not be exposed to these pesticides during their presence in agriculture fields or, given the rapid turnover of these pesticides in the blood and tissues, be exposed to doses below detection level in samples.

We hypothesized that many tree species typical of the climax of sugar maple (Acersaccharum Marsh.) dominated forest have leaf litter with a higher base status than sugar maple and red maple (Acerrubrum L.) leaf litter, and that the base status of leaf litter would be lower on wet sites. Mean differences among species were highly significant (p‚ÄÇ< 0.0001) for all variables related to acidity or bases, but the effect of drainage was not. Red and sugar maple leaf litter was very acid and low in N concentration.

To date, approximately 50 species of Pityophthorus have been recorded in Canada, and these species are associated mainly with coniferous trees. Since 1981, no comprehensive study on this difficult taxonomic group has been conducted in Quebec, Canada, most likely due to their limited significance as forest pests. Based on data gathered from five years of field sampling in conifer seed orchards and compiled from various entomological collections, the distribution of Pityophthorus species in Quebec is presented. Approximately 291 new localities were recorded for the Pityophthorus species. Five species-group taxa, namely Pityophthorus puberulus (LeConte, 1868), Pityophthorus pulchellus pulchellus Eichhoff, 1869, Pityophthorus pulicarius (Zimmermann, 1868), Pityophthorus nitidus Swaine, 1917,and Pityophthorus cariniceps LeConte&Horn, 1876 were the most widespread.

However, little is known about its offsite impacts on plant communities. We assessed the frequency and the abundance of five common boreal understorey plant species (Coptis trifolia (L.) Salisb., Cornus canadensis L., Linnaea borealis L., Lysimachia borealis (Raf.) U.Manns & Anderb., and Maianthemum canadense Desf.) at different distances around six mines in Abitibi-T√©miscamingue and Nord-du-Qu√©bec (Qu√©bec). Frequency and (or) abundance of Coptis trifolia and M. canadense decreased near mines, suggesting that they might be sensitive to the loss of forest cover, particle deposition, and soil contamination induced by mining. Conversely, the frequency and abundance of Cornus canadensis increased near active mines, which indicates its resilience to the stress caused by mines and its ability to exploit the niche space left by more sensitive species. No effects on Linnaea borealis and Lysimachia borealis were observed. Our study suggests the possible presence of offsite impacts of mines on plant communities. Further studies considering enigmatic impacts should be conducted in order to develop our understanding of the broader environmental footprint of mining activity.",,,,,28/4/2021,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Botany,2021,,
https://doi.org/10.4039/Ent119195-2,OVIPOSITION AND NICHE PARTITIONING IN APHIDOPHAGOUS INSECTS ON MAIZE,"Abstract Principal components analysis was used to assess niche partitioning between four aphid predators on the basis of oviposition strategies. The study was conducted by sampling abundance and position of the eggs of these predators in corn monocultures in two locations of southern Quebec. The results indicated that the chrysopid Chrysopa occulata Say laid its eggs on corn leaves usually without aphid colonies, and late in the season. All other predators reacted to aphid concentrations. The syrphid Sphaerophoria philanthus (Mg.) oviposited close to the ground, early in the season, and among colonies of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi (L.). The two coccinellids laid their eggs during July and August with a maximum during tasseling for Coleomegilla maculata lengi (Timberlake) and after pollination for Hippodamia tredecimpunctata tibialis Say. Of these two species, the latter one selected sites at higher levels on the plant, and was more abundant at the edges of the field. It is suggested that the observed niche partitioning cannot be the result of interspecific competition in variable environments such as maize monocultures. R√©sum√© L‚Äôanalyse en composantes principales est utilis√©e afin de mettre en √©vidence la r√©partition de niches de quatre aphidiphages en utilisant leur strat√©gie de ponte.

Paleobiology of Climactichnites, an Enigmatic Late Cambrian Fossil. Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology, number 74, 74 pages, frontispiece, 58 figures, 1993.‚ÄîClimactichnites wilsoni Logan, 1860, is redescribed from field investigations and specimens in various museums. Climactichnites youngi Todd, 1882, and C. fosteri Todd, 1882, are placed in synonymy. The species is known only from its trail, consisting of raised bars and impressed furrows, bounded by two parallel, raised lateral ridges. This structure is interpreted as being formed from damp sand, redistributed and molded by the animal. At a few localities, an oval impression occurs at the origin of the trail; a new locality for this rare feature was found in Wisconsin. In Quebec a trail crossing over itself was found; this phenomenon was known from only one other locality. All occurrences of Climactichnites are in the Late Cambrian; specimens are known from New York, Quebec, Ontario, Wisconsin, and Missouri. This fossil is probably confined to the Dresbachian, the earliest stage of the tri-part Late Cambrian. All examples of trails are in sandstones; these are interpreted as sand flats that were just above water during low tide in the shallow epicontinental sea. A variety of animals have been proposed as the trail maker; they include several different kinds of arthropods, mollusks, and ""worms."" Each proposal has weak points and none of the suggested animal groups has appropriate morphology to produce the marking. The animal is reconstructed as relatively low, broad, and about twice as long as wide. It is hypothesized that the tough body integument secreted mucus which facilitated movement and aided in preservation of the trail. A large flap covered most of the outside body and extended laterally over the muscular foot. Free edges of the flap on either side of the body compressed and molded damp sand into parallel bounding ridges. Respiratory organs may have been present below the flap edges, kept moist by being partially enclosed. By moving the edges of these lateral flaps, the organism may have been able to swim when in water. Most trails of Climactichnites are interpreted as a consequence of feeding activity. If so, food was taken in through a circular mouth located anteriorward on the ventral surface; this morphologic feature is inferred from circular markings seen on a few bars. As reconstructed, the sand under the animal was compressed anteriorly and laterally; the animal then brushed particles forward into a small dune-like bar, probably by the action of cilia on its ventral surface. Sand dwelling microorganisms displaced by brushing were concentrated centrally, obviating ingestion of large amounts of sediment. What sediment was taken in was released at irregular intervals through a posterior anus; medial marking on parts of some trails are interpreted as fecal strings. The complex clamping and brushing behavior, implies a well-developed nervous system. No body fossils are known in the Vendian or in the Paleozoic that could have constructed this form of trail. The proposed method of feeding, if correctly interpreted, is unique. Thus the trail of Climactichnites may constitute the work of an otherwise unknown phylum in the animal kingdom.

,Pannaria lurida in Atlantic Canada,"Apart from several unconfirmed reports of Pannaria lurida (Mont.) Nyl. in Quebec (Lepage, 1947, 1958; to be discussed below) and a very doubtful o ne from Newfoundland or labrador (Eckfeldt 1895, as Physma luridum Mont.), noth ing is known about the occurrence of this interesting but often overlooked species in Ca nada. Pannaria lurida belongs to the P. rubiginosa group (J0rgensen 1978) and is distinguished from the most closely related species, P. rubiginosa (Ach.) Bory, by its larger, conspicuously wrinkled and often greyish green thallus lobes (Fig 1A & B). The more greyish coloration is caused by the pronounced accumulation o f pannarin, a chlori nated depsidone which is produced in lesser amounts in P. rubiginosa and its sorediate counterpart P. conoplea (Ach.) Bory. The algal symbiont is Nostoc as is usual with members of Pannariaceae. Specimens in the Smithsonian Institution (US) and the Farlow Herbarium (FH) i ndicate that P. lurida had been collected at least as far north as Maine (South Thomaston and Warren in Knox County and Salisbury Cove in Hancock County). The species seems to be restricted to the eastern seaboard of northern North America, the so utheastern U.S.A. (Hale 1979) and some mountains in the Caribbean, altho ugh so me misidentified specimens of Pannaria from the Hawaiian Islands have been seen under this name (GB, Goteborg). During our surveys of forest lichens in eastern Canada and the adjacent parts of Maine we have noted the presence of P. lurida in southern Nova Scotia and less frequently along the Northumberland Straits and in eastern Maine (Fig 2). These areas are more or less strongly influenced by an oceanic el i mate and lie outside or along the edge of the boreal coniferous zone. The habitats are mostly very wet mixed forests in which Fraxinus americana l., F. nigra Marsh. and Acer rubrum L. are dominant. Pannaria lurida is a rare member of the lobarion. It often grows together with related species of Pannaria, most often P. rubiginosa and P. conoplea but also P. ahlneri P. M. ]0rg. and P. leucosticta (Tuck. in Darl .) Nyl. (in southern Nova Scotia). By cont rast to these species, all of which are able to grow on coniferous bark, especiall y on that of Thuja, P. lurida has been fo und only on deciduo us trees.

Both species are common, semiaquatic bugs (Hemiptera; Gerridae) found on the surface of streams and small rivers. Allozyme studies have shown them to be more distantly related than most other congeneric species in the Gerridae, with significant barriers to gene flow where their ranges abut. We assess postmating reproductive isolation between A. remigoides and A. remigis, using a bracket cross design with five sampling sites along a north‚Äìsouth cline traversing the hybrid zone. We also report the results of long-distance conspecific crosses of A. remigis, using populations from California and Quebec. Neither these nor the intraspecific bracket crosses reveal any evidence of isolation by distance within species. However, heterospecific crosses show significantly reduced fertility, hatching success, survival of both sexes to eclosion (final moult) and percentage of males. Egg production is not influenced by cross type, and we found no evidence of hybrid sterility in either sex. Analyses of genotypic frequencies at three isozyme loci in eight hybrid and 22 pure populations reveal significant deficiencies of heterozygotes in hybrid populations. The proportion of males is also significantly lower in hybrid populations than in pure populations. The laboratory and field results indicate that postmating isolation between these two species occurs in the form of severe reductions in both the fertility of heterospecific crosses and the viability of hybrids, particularly hybrid males. Genetic mechanisms for Haldane's rule and asymmetries in the reciprocal heterospecific crosses are discussed.",,,Heterozygote; Fertility; Two-Hybrid System Techniques; Genotype; Hemiptera; Infertility; Reproduction; Hybrids; Reproductive Isolation; Gerridae; hatching; Isoenzymes; Gene Flow,,1/6/1997,,8,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"New Brunswick, Maine"

Glossy buckthorn has impacts on the biodiversity and productivity of invaded forests. Currently, we do not know much about the species‚Äô ecology and no thorough study of its distribution in temperate forests has been performed yet. As is often the case with invasive plant species, the phenology of glossy buckthorn differs from that of other indigenous plant species found in invaded communities. In the forests of eastern Canada, the main phenological difference is a delay in the shedding of glossy buckthorn leaves, which occurs later in the fall than for other indigenous tree species found in that region. Therefore, our objective was to use that phenological characteristic to map the spatial distribution of glossy buckthorn over a portion of southern Qu√©bec, Canada, using remote sensing-based approaches. We achieved this by applying a linear temporal unmixing model to a time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images to create a map of the probability of the occurrence of glossy buckthorn for the study area. The map resulting from the temporal unmixing model shows an agreement of 69% with field estimates of glossy buckthorn occurrence measured in 121 plots distributed over the study area. Glossy buckthorn mapping accuracy was limited by evergreen species and by the spectral and spatial resolution of the Landsat 8 OLI.",,,Multispectral image; Time series,,13/3/2020,,1,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,Frangula alnus,,,,,,,,,,,Remote Sensing,2020,,

A source of recent heated debate has been how such global changes, including land transformation, affect species richness and ecosystem functioning. Growing scientific consensus suggests that more diverse communities support greater ecosystem functioning; however, species numbers might fluctuate over time, and ecosystem processes are shaped by both species richness and species identities. In recent decades, habitat loss and major biodiversity change has occurred on the edge of urban centres because of land transformation to suburban development. Biological surveys provide a valuable record of how biodiversity has responded to this habitat transformation, especially if they have been conducted in the same location over time. Here, we examine changes in species richness, composition and phylogenetic structure between two surveys of vascular plants conducted over 50¬†years apart on Mont St. Hilaire, Qu√©bec, Canada‚Äîa UNESCO Biosphere Reserve surrounded by residential development. We found 198 more species in the more recent survey, but failed to detect 70 species that had been recorded in the earlier survey. A significant number of species gains were closely-related introduced non-native species. Species found only during the first survey (species losses) were frequently native species of special conservation status, and these species tended to be more evolutionarily distinct than species gained. Our results demonstrate that, in a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, there have been significant changes in species richness and composition over the last half-century that might have far-reaching effects on ecosystem properties.",,,Tracheobionta; Phylogenetics; Global change; Community; Ecosystem; Sensorineural Hearing Loss (disorder); Gain; Sense of identity (observable entity); Biosphere; UNESCO,,1/3/2019,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,Biodiversity and Conservation,2019,,

The primary reservoir host of the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, is the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), whose range is rapidly shifting north into southern Qu√©bec. The deer mouse, P. maniculatus, is occurring over most Qu√©bec province and is a less competent host for B. burgdorferi. Here, we compared the phylogeographic structure of both Peromyscus species in Qu√©bec. Using a combination of multiple mitochondrial DNA markers and phylogeographic methods, we detected an ongoing and rapid expansion of P. leucopus, while P. maniculatus appears more stable. Haplotype and populations networks indicated that populations of P. maniculatus exhibit more genetic structure than P. leucopus across the study area. Furthermore, significant and consistent genetic divergences between populations of the two species on both sides of the St. Lawrence River suggest that distinct lineages of P. leucopus and P. maniculatus with different ancestral origins colonized Southern Qu√©bec following the Last Glacial Maximum. The phylogeographic structure of pathogens is expected to mirror the structure observed in their reservoir hosts. As different strains of Borrelia burgdorferi may be associated with different levels of pathogenicity and immune responses of their hosts, our results are helpful at better understanding the pattern of spread of Lyme disease in a zone of emergence, and associated risk for human populations.",,,Haplotypes; Reservoir Device Component; Lyme Disease; National origin; Peromyscus; Immune response,,3/12/2015,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,site coordinates,NA,no,"Peromyscus leucopus, Peromyscus maniculatus",2011,source publication text,1,NA,40000,NA,presence-absence,,,,Biodiversity and Conservation,,,
https://doi.org/10.5558/TFC65206-3,Plant Composition in Relation to Vole Damage in Coniferous Plantations,"We analysed the plant composition of several coniferous plantations of Eastern Townships of Quebec to examine the relationships between biomass patterns and levels of damage made by meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) to young trees. The biomass of the most abundant grass species was compared in severely damaged, lightly damaged and undamaged plantations. Damage indices per plantation were standardized using the composite Mizushima (1976) index. Total biomass did not differ between the three categories of plantations analysed. However, heavily damaged plantations contained significantly more biomass of Virginia strawberry (Fragaria virginiana) and less of couch-grass (Agropyron repens). Debarking damage by voles was not concentrated on specific coniferous species but occurred rather in meadows where Fragaria was relatively more abundant.

We present a time-efficient method to estimate the relative reproductive activity of the forest songbird community. A recording of mobbing calls of Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) was broadcast at pre-selected stations during the breeding season. These calls attracted individuals of many bird species present in the vicinity, allowing visual detection of reproductive activity (e.g., adults carrying food or presumed pairs). In mature deciduous forests of northern New Brunswick, 50 bird species responded to the playbacks. Playbacks significantly increased the probability of visual observations of birds compared to silent observations conducted before broadcasting mobbing calls. In coniferous forests of central Qu√©bec, playbacks attracted 24 species and also provided a significantly greater opportunity to make visual observations of individual birds. In New Brunswick, mobbing playbacks facilitated more observations of reproductive evidence relative to point counts. Observation periods were brief and a 306-ha plot (1.75 √ó 1.75 km, 64 points spaced 250 m apart) could be surveyed by foot in less than 32 observer-hours. The proportion of individuals of a given species showing evidence of reproductive activity was used as an index of reproductive success. Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens) and Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) had a reproductive index consistent with their true nesting success as derived from intensive nest monitoring on the same plots.",,,,,1/7/2000,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,BioOne,2000,,
,"Population , reproductive success , ' and analysis of contaminants in Razorbills ( Alea torda ) in the estuary and Gulf of St . Lawrence , Quebec by","Introduction The seabird survey program in the sanctuaries on the North Shore of the Gulf of St Lawrence has enabled us to follow the fluctuations in population of several species from 1925 to 1977 (Chapdelaine 1980). Alcidae and Laridae are the principal families surveyed, representing 56070 and 37% respectively of the total. Among the Alcidae, Razorbills (Alea torda) and Puffins (Fratereula aretiea) in particular have decreased in numbers sin ce 1965. ln this project, we dealt with Razorbills because of their large numbers in the estuary and Gulf of St Lawrence. B√©dard (1969) estimated the Razorbill population of Canada to be 42 200, with 50""70 occurring in the estuary and gulf. More recently, Nettleship (1977) estimated this population at 38 130 birds. On the basis of this revised figure and the most recent data (Table 1), the number of Razorbills in the estuary and gulf would represent no more than 18% of the total in the western Atlantic. The purpose of this project is to update the information on the distribution and abundance of Razorbills in the estuary and Gulf of St Lawrence and to present sorne biological parameters on reproduction and the presence of contaminants in eggs. This approach wiII help to orient more specifie studies, whieh could lead ta identification of the reasons for the de cline in the Razorbill population in the gulf.",,,,,2012,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,H,article,article,"site coordinates, geographic feature, administrative unit",NA,Map,Alca torda,1940-1979,source publication text,no,NA,250000,no,abundance,,,,,,,data about c.18 colonies
https://doi.org/10.2307/3235615,Population age structure of Pinus banksiana at the southern edge of the Canadian boreal forest,". To assess the effects of site type, forest initiation periods and fire regimes on the dynamics of Pinus banksiana (Jack pine), the age structure of 69 populations of the species was analyzed. Two landscapes with different fire regimes were selected in the southern part of the Canadian boreal forest in Quebec: the ‚Äòmainland landscape‚Äô is characterized by a fire regime of large lethal fires, the ‚Äòisland landscape‚Äô is affected by a complex fire regime including lethal and non-lethal fires. Age structure was compared between forest initiation periods and site types (mesic mainland, xeric mainland and xeric island) using the Shannon regularity index. An even-aged population structure was found within the first 100 yr following a lethal fire, while after that period the population structure becomes more uneven-aged. Under mesic conditions, populations tend to have an even-aged structure, under xeric conditions an uneven-aged structure. Natural openings present in xeric sites allow for recruitment in the absence of fire. This permits the self-maintenance of Pinus banksiana. Xeric island populations show more uneven-aged structures than xeric mainland populations. The occurrence of non-lethal fires on the islands creates uneven-aged structures. Further, the results suggest that the selection pressure of the island fire regime, favouring non-serotinous and mixed P. banksiana individuals, is one of the factors responsible for a higher recruitment in the absence of fire on islands than on the mainland.",,,,,1/12/1993,,5,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,appendix,article,no,NA,site coordinates,Pinus banksiana,no,NA,no,NA,no,NA,abundance,,,,Journal of Vegetation Science,,,58 populations of Pinus banksiana.

In general, mean abundance of Diplostomumspp. in the lens of spottail shiners was highest at sites near large ring-billed gull ( Larus delawarensis ) colonies and was higher in 1998 than in 1997. Population studies demonstrated a major period of recruitment in the late summer ‚Äì early autumn. Mean abundance increased between November and May, when sampling was logistically not possible, reflecting latefall or early-spring recruitment. Golden shiners ( Notemigonus crysoleucas ) and small yellow perch ( Perca flavescens ) were monitored at a single site (√éle aux Ours) in 1997 and 1998. Mean abundance of Diplostomumspp. in the lens of golden shiners at √éle aux Ours was higher in 1998 than in 1997. Recruitment occurred in the early summer and be tween November and May, suggesting late-fall or early-spring transmission. Mean abundance decreased between Au gust and October in both years. Yellow perch at √éle aux Ours were infected with four different parasite species in their eyes. Mean abundance of Diplostomumspp. in the vitreous humour or retina increased during the summer and fall and then decreased between the fall and following spring. Diplostomumspp. in the lens increased in abundance in the early summer, and then decreased during the fall. Both Tylodelphys scheuringi and Neascusspp. in the vitreous humour were more abundant in 0+ than in 1+ perch. Mean abundance of T. scheuringiincreased over the summer in 1997 and then dropped to zero in the same cohort over winter, suggesting that the parasite lives for only 1 year. Neascusspp. only were found in 1998. Distributional data, together with seasonal information, suggest that habitat characteristics contribute significantly to the abundance of Diplostomumspp. along the St. Lawrence River. Proximity to gull colonies enhances abundance, but higher rates of predation at wetland sites depress abundance and restrict the accumulation of parasites. 1113 R√©sum√©: L‚Äôinfection par la douve de l‚Äôoeil chez le Queue √† tache noire ( Notropis hudsonius ) a fait l‚Äôobjet d‚Äôun suivi mensuel du printemps √† l‚Äôautomne 1997 et 1998, √† quatre sites du fleuve Saint-Laurent, Qu√©bec.

Une premi√®re phase de recrutement du parasite s‚Äôest pro duite au d√©but de l‚Äô√©t√© et une deuxi√®me entre novembre et mai, ce qui semble indiquer une transmission automnale tar dive ou printani√®re h√¢tive. On a observ√© une diminution de l‚Äôabondance moyenne entre ao√ªt et octobre au cours des 2 ann√©es d‚Äô√©chantillonnage. Les yeux des perchaudes de l‚Äô√Æle aux Ours √©taient infect√©s par quatre esp√®ces de parasites. L‚Äôabondance moyenne de Diplostomumspp. dans l‚Äôhumeur vitreuse ou la r√©tine des perchaudes a subi une augmentation au cours de l‚Äô√©t√© et de l‚Äôautomne pour ensuite d√©cro√Ætre entre la fin de l‚Äôautomne et le printemps suivant.

We found that contemporary populations of the two species are distinct in morphology and interpret this differentiation as a reflection of resource partitioning, a mechanism favouring their local coexistence. While there was no size trend, geographic or temporal, both species displayed a concomitant change in the shape of their skull over the last 50¬†years, although this change was much more apparent in the white-footed mouse. As a result, the two species diverged over time and became more distinct in their morphology. The observed changes in morphology are large given the short time scale. During this period, there was also a shift in abundance of the two species in Southern Quebec, consistent with the northern displacement of the range of the white-footed mouse in the last 15¬†years. Our study thus reports the changes in morphology of two co-occurring mammal species that were accompanied by changes in distribution and local abundance, potentially in response to rapid climate change.",,,Displacement mapping; Manuscripts; Ecology; Coexist (image); Galaxy morphological classification; Genus; Population; Multitier architecture; Specimen Collection; Biological specimen; Mathematical morphology; Peromyscus; RL (complexity); Interaction,,2/8/2017,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,"article, appendix",".xlsx, article","site coordinates, site IDs, administrative unit",NA,Map,"Peromyscus maniculatus, Peromyscus leucopus",1959-2011,source publication text,46,source publication text,17000,no,abundance,,,,Evolutionary Ecology,,,12 years total
https://doi.org/10.1111/EFP.12161,Recent insights into the pandemic disease butternut canker caused by the invasive pathogen Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum.,"Summary 
 
 
In the 25¬†years following the initial 1967 report of the disease, butternut canker was able to quickly spread throughout the entire range of butternut (Juglans cinerea) in North America, from Minnesota in the upper Midwest to Tennessee in the south and Quebec in the north-east. The speed of this dispersal is notable as butternut trees do not make up a significant proportion of any single forest type. Instead, they are usually found sparingly in most mixed hardwood forests. In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge of the invasion process of the butternut canker pathogen, Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum, an invasive fungal pathogen, that as its emergence has spread across North America and is now found wherever butternut naturally occurs. Taxonomic studies have determined that the fungus belongs in the genus Ophiognomonia, which includes a number of saprophytes, endophytes and pathogens of members of the Fagales, rather than the genus Sirococcus, which includes several important pine pathogens. The ability of fungus to be dispersed by rain splash, transported on and in beetle vectors, transmitted by infected seed and successfully colonized several species of Juglans and Carya have all likely contributed to the rapid increase in abundance and severity of disease and tree mortality in the invaded forest ecosystems. Recent genomic and population genetic analyses have determined that there were at least three emergence events. A less virulent strain of the fungus likely has been present in the north eastern United States for over a century, but it was the emergence of a more virulent strain of the fungus in Minnesota and Wisconsin in the 1960s that resulted in range-wide mortality and pushed butternut to be listed as an endangered species in Canada and a number of states in the United States.",,,,,1/2/2015,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,Map,Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum,,,,,,,,,,,Forest Pathology,2014,,
https://doi.org/10.1093/SYSBIO%2F35.1.68,Reconstructing biogeographic history using phylogenetic-tree analysis of community structure,"The dispersal of a community in a territory can be reconstructed using various more or less specific methods of data analysis. When the data are in the form of presence/ absence of species for the various units of territory, or in the form of frequencies of occurrence, they are analogous to the data used for reconstructing evolutionary trees. Furthermore, when one is looking for a treelike structure of dispersal, issued from a common trunk, the tree- reconstruction methods may represent an appropriate analytical tool. Four tree-reconstruction methods are found to be appropriate in their hypotheses. They lead to satisfactory trees when applied to a data set describing the geographic distribution of the stenohaline freshwater fishes of the Quebec peninsula, previously divided into 21 regions. For binary data, the method of Camin and Sokal and the polymorphism parsimony method were used with success, while the continuous character data maximum-likelihood method and the least-squares method of Cavalli- Sforza and Edwards were applied to frequency-of-occurrence data. When compared to a method of pairwise comparison of adjacent regions, it is shown that the tree-reconstruction methods provide the user with information that is not found otherwise. I also show that external infor- mation (i.e., geographic adjacencies, and the degree of asymmetry of the faunal vectors of regions connected by the tree), available in biogeographic data but not taken into account by the tree-reconstruction algorithms, must be considered to render the results meaningful.

Ecologists have developed methods to select which habitats should be conserved. The Ecological value, a method based on vegetation, has been created for the urban habitats of Montreal (Quebec, Canada). The main objective of our study was to determine if this method was relevant to assess carabid diversity of Mount Royal Park. This index is calculated using five criteria: uniqueness, representativeness, degree of succession, richness and rarity of the flora, each of which can influence communities of insects. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were selected because of their success as biological indicators. Despite sampling difficulties, our results demonstrate clearly that the Ecological value method does not represent the high carabid richness of urban open habitats (tall grasses) and their specialised native carabid species. Within forests we found nonetheless that the ecological value index has a significant positive relationship with native carabid abundance. Moreover, maturity and structure of urban forests were positively correlated with carabid abundance and richness. Some urban vegetation characteristics have been shown to influence entomological diversity, but the relevance of using a global floral index to encompass the carabid community seems limited.",,,Sampling (signal processing); Forests; Succession; Order Coleoptera; Community; Poaceae; Ground state; Habitat; Relevance; Insecta; Capability Maturity Model,,1/8/2009,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,site IDs,NA,site coordinates,c 36 Carabid species,2002-2003,source publication text,1,NA,0.5,no,abundance,,,,Journal of Insect Conservation,,,

Water samples were collected at each sampling site with in situ diffusion samplers and analyzed for major cations, anions and trace metals (Cd, Cu, Mn, Zn). Surficial sediment samples were also collected at each site and analyzed for Cd, Cu and Zn. In response to Cd contamination at river and lake sites, both sentinel organisms accumulated the metal and synthesized metallothionein (MT), a metal-binding protein synthesized by organisms as a defence mechanism against excess metals in the surrounding media. At the river sites, H. limbata unexpectedly maintained much higher concentrations of MT per unit of accumulated Cd than at the lake sites; this difference between lentic and lotic environments may reflect the response of the species to the more stressful hydrodynamic conditions that prevail in a river. The accumulation of Cd in the mayflies at lake and river sites decreased as a function of the ambient manganese concentration. We hypothesize that dissolved Mn protects against Cd bioaccumulation in H. limbata. The present results support the contention that one cannot extrapolate conclusions drawn from the use of a single sentinel species to a larger set of freshwater invertebrates--both the mayfly and the bivalve are promising biomonitors.",,,Collections (publication); Metallothionein; Manuscripts; negative regulation of reactive oxygen species biosynthetic process; Hydrodynamics; Natural Science Disciplines; Copper; Large; Cations; Class Bivalvia; Anions; Invertebrates; Manganese; Swyer-James Syndrome; Metals; Ephemeroptera; 11-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid; Acclimatization; Larva; Cadmium; Sentinel Species,,15/1/2010,,7,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,article,article,"site coordinates, geographic feature",NA,Map,"Hexagenia limbata, Pyganodon grandis","1994-1997, 2000-2001",source publication text,4,no,6400,no,presence-only,,,,Journal of Environmental Monitoring,,,

This phenomenon could be inhibited by large herbivores through selective browsing that reduces shrub growth. Our objective was to assess the dynamics of shrub species in the Deception Bay area, in Nunavik (Qu√©bec, Canada), a region in the summer range of the Rivi√®re-aux-Feuilles migratory caribou herd. We surveyed abundance and stem mortality of all shrub species along systematically located transects in a 54¬†km2 area. Our results showed that shrubs covered 11.5% of the area, and were dominated by prostrate Betula glandulosa (8.7%). Stem mortality of established individuals was greater for Salix planifolia (45.6%) and Salix glauca (46.5%) than for B. glandulosa (9.3%). Using dendrochronological analysis, we determined the age structure of the two dominant erect shrub species in ten 10¬†m¬†√ó¬†10¬†m plots. We recorded a high number of B. glandulosa and, to a lesser extent, of S. planifolia recruits (71.0 and 4.6 per 100¬†m2, respectively) established after 1999, when the Rivi√®re-aux-Feuilles herd was abundant. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis that large herbivores counteracted the positive effects of climate change on shrub recruitment. However, since the structure of the recruits are prostrate rather than erect, as is usually observed with shrub expansion in the warming Arctic, it is likely that herbivory, and/or, the harsh climate, is constraining habitat change.",,,Manuscripts; Mike Lesser; Field research; Herbivory; Large; Image resolution; Square Kilometer; Natural Science Disciplines; Tree accumulation; Reindeer; Diethylstilbestrol; Linear algebra; standards characteristics; Willow,,9/5/2018,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,"Betula glandulosa, Salix planifolia",,,,,,,,,,,Polar Biology,2018,,

We assessed female ruffed grouse habitat characteristics during winter of 2001‚Äì2002 and 2002‚Äì2003 in a region dominated by mixed softwood‚Äìhardwood forests by comparing used and random locations. We followed 23 radiotagged adult females in 2 forest sites of the R√©serve faunique de Portneuf, Qu√©bec, Canada, from late November to mid-April. We described grouse habitat using ground surveys and identified selected habitat characteristics using analysis of variance and logistic regression. Females preferred mixed softwood‚Äìhardwood stands >17 m tall and 61‚Äì120 years old. Compared with random locations, grouse locations had more well-developed total canopy cover (>4 m; 75%), canopy (>4 m; 35%), midstory (1‚Äì4 m tall; 35%), and lower-story (<1 m tall; 23%) coniferous cover, and higher coniferous stem density and tree basal area (dbh > 9 cm; 343 stems/ha and 9.0 m2/ha, respectively).

,"Scientific literature on the origins of Didymo , felt soled wading boots , and vectors for some aquatic invasive species","We outline, in chronological sequence, the events and findings over 25 years that have shaped our understanding of Didymosphenia geminate (Lyngbye) M. Schmidt blooms. Starting with the first appearance of D. geminata mats in streams on Vancouver Island in the late 1980s and followed years later by blooms in Iceland, South Dakota and Poland, D. geminata blooms were enigmatic for nearly 20 years. Early papers exploring whether blooms were caused by environmental change consistently failed to identify any specific factor(s) associated with their onset. Following the D. geminata outbreak in New Zealand in 2004 that seemed to result from an introduction of the species, the possibility that blooms that had previously occurred elsewhere in the world might also be explained by the introduction and movement among watersheds of a new variant with a bloom-forming tendency was touted and widely accepted. Now, however, the identification of very low soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP; below ‚àº2 ppb) as the proximate cause of bloom formation, has led to the more likely explanation that D. geminata blooms are the result of large-scale human intervention in climatic, atmospheric and edaphic processes that favour this ultra-oligotrophic species. In this new view, blooms of D. geminata are not simply due to the introduction of cells into new areas. Rather, bloom formation occurs when the SRP concentration is low, or is reduced to low levels by the process of oligotrophication. Mechanisms that potentially cause oligotrophication on global and regional scales are identified. Taylor, B. W; and M. L. Bothwell. 2014.

Abstract: Management authorities often perceive Didymosphenia geminata (didymo) as an invasive, nuisance diatom species that has been introduced to eastern Canada; however, observations from early 20th century diatom surveys challenge this characterization. We apply paleolimnological techniques to place recent didymo blooms from Gasp√©sie, Quebec, into historical and environmental context. Sedimentary diatom assemblages were examined from Lac Humqui (a headwater lake) and Lac au Saumon (a lake with an inflowing river currently supporting blooms). The Lac Humqui assemblage experienced a broad-scale shift in their dominant life strategy with declines in fragilarioid taxa and increases in planktonic diatoms (i.e., Cyclotella‚ÄìDiscostella species) that began_1970 and increased to modern abundances_1990. Strong relationships between this diatom shift and increases in regional air temperatures and earlier river ice-out dates are consistent with longer growing seasons and enhanced thermal stability in Lac Humqui. Didymo was observed throughout the Lac au Saumon core, demonstrating that it has been present in the region since at least _1970. Our paleolimnological evidence indicates that blooms likely form in response to regional consequences of climate warming, rather than human introduction.

The bloom-forming freshwater stalked diatom Didymosphenia geminata is unusual among algae in that nuisance growths occur almost exclusively in oligotrophic waters. Current hypotheses to explain this phenomenon have assumed supplemental acquisition of phosphorus from novel sources within the stalk ‚ÅÑmat matrix. 2. We carried out a synoptic survey of river sites in the South Island, New Zealand, to determine whether D. geminata cell division and stalk development (measured as mat coverage or standing crop) were related to ambient phosphorus concentrations in the overlying river water. 3. High coverage (>50%) by D. geminata was largely concentrated at sites with mean dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) <2 mg m) in the overlying water. Didymosphenia geminata was present at only one site with DRP >4 mg m)3, with very low coverage. Cell division rate (measured as the frequency of dividing cells, FDC) was positively correlated with mean DRP suggesting that division rates were controlled by the available phosphorus concentration in ambient river water. At the same time, FDC was negatively correlated with D. geminata standing crop (measured as an index incorporating percentage cover and mat thickness). 4. In a single river reach with a stable cross-channel gradient of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) caused by inflows from a high-nutrient tributary, again we observed a negative correlation between percentage cover by D. geminata and concentrations of TDP. 5. Finally, we made a series of observations on D. geminata-dominated communities that had been exposed to water enriched with NO3 -N and PO4 -P for 4 weeks, followed by exposure to unenriched water. After 2 weeks of nutrient deprivation, D. geminata cell division rates declined by 60%, mean stalk length increased by 250%, and total carbohydrate quadrupled relative to initial values. The appearance of the community changed from a dark brown mat to a thick pale mat typical of D. geminata blooms. 6. All these results indicate that D. geminata cell division rates are actively controlled by concentrations of available phosphorus in the overlying water and that stalk production (represented by mat thickness and extent, stalk length and total carbohydrate) is inversely related to D. geminata cell division rates. They thus support an explanation for D. geminata blooms in oligotrophic rivers tied to enhanced stalk production in nutrient-poor waters, rather than through acquisition of additional phosphorus through recycling processes within the mat.

 We describe seasonal patterns of parasitism by Telenomus coloradensis Crawford, Telenomus droozi Muesebeck, Telenomus flavotibiae Pelletier (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae), and Trichogramma spp. (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae), egg parasitoids of the hemlock looper, Lambdina fiscellaria (Guen√©e) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), after a 3-yr survey of defoliated stands in the lower St. Lawrence region (Quebec, Canada). Results from sentinel trap sampling indicate that T. coloradensis and T. droozi are the most common species, whereas parasitism by T. flavotibiae and Trichogramma spp. is rare. Telenomus coloradensis and T. droozi show similar seasonal periods of parasitism, both species being active in early spring (late April) at temperatures as low as 4¬∞C. Using thermal threshold (T0) and thermal constant (K) for immature development of T. coloradensis males and females from egg to adult emergence, we estimated that the spring progeny emerges in the middle of the summer while hemlock looper eggs are absent from the forest environment. Parasitoid females would then mate and remain in the environment to 1) exploit alternate host species, 2) enter into quiescence and later parasitize eggs laid by hemlock looper females in the fall, 3) enter into a reproductive diapause and parasitize hemlock looper eggs only the next spring, or all of these. Although previous studies have shown that T. coloradensis can overwinter in its immature form within the host egg, our field and laboratory results indicate that in the lower St. Lawrence region, this species principally enters diapause as fertilized females, with a mean supercooling point of -30.6¬∞C in the fall.",,,Ecology; Ovum; parasitism; Reproduction; Lambdina fiscellaria nucleopolyhedrovirus; Scelionidae; Diapause; Geometridae; Hymenoptera; Lepidoptera; Tsuga,,24/12/2012,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,geographic feature,NA,site coordinates,"Telenomus spp, Hemlock Looper",2002-2005,source publication text,no,NA,0.5,source publication text,abundance,,,,Environmental Entomology,,,
https://doi.org/10.1603/EN10045,Selected Beetle Assemblages Captured in Pitfall Traps Baited with Deer Dung or Meat in Balsam Fir and Sugar Maple Forests of Central Quebec,"ABSTRACT Vertebrate dung and carrion are rich and strongly attractive resources for numerous beetles that are often closely linked to them. The presence and abundance of beetles exploiting such resources are influenced by various ecological factors including climate and forest cover vegetation. We studied selected assemblages of coprophilous and necrophagous beetles in Quebec along a 115-km north-south transect in three balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Miller) forest sites and in a fourth forest site dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall), close to the southern fir site. Beetle abundance was estimated using a sampling design comprising replicated pitfall traps baited with red deer meat or dung in each site. A total of 8,511 beetles were caught and identified to family level, 95.7% of which belonged to families with known coprophilous or necrophagous behavior. Meat-baited pitfall traps caught nearly 15 times as many beetles as dung-baited traps. All Histeridae, Hydrophilidae, Scarabaeidae, and Silphidae were identified to species to examine specific diversity variation among sites. For the beetles caught in the meat-baited traps (majority of captures), decreases in abundance and species richness were observed from south to north along the fir forest transect, with evidence of decreasing specific diversity as measured by the Shannon index of diversity. Strong differences in species assemblages were also observed between the southern maple and fir forest sites. The Silphidae and Histeridae were more abundant in the maple forest, whereas the Hydrophilidae and Ptilidae were more abundant in the fir forest.",,,Forests; Order Coleoptera; Abies; Balsams; Acer; Feces; Carrion beetle; Saccharum,,1/8/2010,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,no,NA,site coordinates,c.30 beetle species,2006,source publication text,<1,no,no,NA,abundance,,,,Environmental Entomology,,,

Surveys were conducted, 2 years before and 2 years after logging, to determine the relative abundance of 12 wildlife species, and telemetry data were also gathered on four species. Small mammals, species with the smallest home ranges (1 ha), either remained in the clearcut patches or had replacement habitat in the buffer strips. Most species with home ranges up to 25 ha (spruce grouse, Falcipennis canadensis Linne; snowshoe hare, Lepus americanus Erxleben) were excluded from clearcut patches. Species with home ranges 5 km2 (marten, Martes americana Turton; moose, Alces alces Linne) remained in some residual forest patches scattered throughout clearcuts and in the adjacent uncut forest.

The objectives of this study were to characterize the foliar predatory fauna associated with A. glycines in commercial soybean fields in Qu√©bec, Canada, and to evaluate the suitability of A. glycines as prey for three coccinellid species: Harmonia axyridis Pallas, Propylea quatuordecimpunctata L. and Coleomegilla maculata lengi Timberlake (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Field surveys showed that several predators responded rapidly to expanding and increasing populations of the soybean aphid. Coccinellidae were the most important aphidophagous predators observed in 2002 (58.6%) and 2003 (44.8%), with mainly four native and naturalized species co-occurring with the soybean aphid throughout the growing season. Measurement of fitness parameters under laboratory conditions (survival, development time, longevity, fecundity) indicated that A. glycines is an excellent prey for the development and reproduction of all three of the coccinellid species studied. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) was highest for H. axyridis (0.238¬†d‚àí1), intermediate for P. quatuordecimpunctata (0.215¬†d‚àí1) and lowest for C. maculata (0.134¬†d‚àí1).",,,Coccinellidae; Fertility; Propylea quatuordecimpunctata; Population; Soybeans; Arthropods; Harmonia <angiosperm>; Aphids; Aphis glycines; PALLAS; Prey,,1/2/2006,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,Aphis glycines,,,,,,,,,,,BioControl,2006,,

The corolla spotting and colour morphs in I. pallida each appear to be determined by different pairs of unlinked loci. Dominant alleles at each locus pair are required for the expression of corolla spotting or yellow corolla colouration. Stem waxiness in I. capensis is also shown to be under genetic control. Significant clustering of identical flower and stem phenotypes at small interplant distances was observed in most population samples, suggesting substructuring of genotypes in space. The sizes of patches where morph frequencies occurred in excess of random expectations were found to be consistent among populations and polymorphisms within the species, lending support to the interpretation that substructuring of genetic variation in these populations is due to restricted gene dispersal. The population genetical consequences of limited gene flow in these species is discussed.",,,Impatiens pallida; Spatial analysis; Variation (Genetics); Phenotype; Genotype; Genetic Polymorphism; Corolla (plant part); Autocorrelation; Offset binary; Corolla (genus); Metrorrhagia; LOCUS; Cluster analysis; Patch (computing); Population; Hemicordylus capensis; Gene Flow,,1/10/1989,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,"Impatiens pallida, Impatiens capensis",,,,,,,,,,,Heredity,1989,,
https://doi.org/10.1357/002224009788597926,Spatial interactions in the Macoma balthica community control biogeochemical fluxes at the sediment-water interface and microbial abundances,"We examined how interactions among the three dominant species of the Macoma balthica community in the St-Lawrence estuary influence net biogeochemical fluxes and the composition of the sedimentary bacterial community. We manipulated the biodiversity of the community via combinations of Macoma balthica, Mya arenaria, and Nereis virens in sediment microcosms containing sieved and homogenized tidal-flat sediment. Each combination was adjusted to similar total biovolumes and in situ animal densities. Compared to treatments with single species, which were also adjusted to similar biovolumes and densities, combinations of multiple species changed the fluxes of oxygen, phosphate, ammonium, and nitrate across the sediment-water interface and altered the composition of the microbial community beyond the level predicted by linear addition of the single species effects. Most combinations involved positive interactions that increased net fluxes. Although N. virens dominated system behavior, we also observed positive interactions between the two bivalves, and between N. virens and M. balthica. Weaker interactions, sometimes negative, were observed between N. virens and M. arenaria. Most effects could be directly linked to total oxic sediment volumes and burrow volumes generated by the different species. N. virens had the maximum species-specific burrow volume/biovolume ratio, and its presence maximally impacted fluxes. The principal interactions between species that affect net solute fluxes reflect space occupation, life habit (position, location), and irrigation of burrows. These factors interact with reactive substrate distributions and remineralization patterns to produce particular flux balances. Future studies should include the relationships of biodiversity to spatial scales over which the functional groups are distributed, the volumes actively occupied and irrigated, production rates of burrows, and the depths to which the organisms burrow. 1.

https://doi.org/10.1139/B05-025,Spontaneous revegetation of mined peatlands in eastern Canada,"Many North American peatlands previously mined for horticultural peat have been abandoned recently, al- lowing natural recolonization to occur. The two dominant methods for peat extraction, hand block-cutting and vacuum- mining, have created distinctly different abandoned surfaces, leading to different recolonization patterns. Both types of exploitation can be found throughout eastern Canada where we conducted a vast survey of 26 abandoned mined peatlands in the provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick. The aim of this study is to describe the revegetation pat- terns and to assess the impact of local and regional variables as well as the time since abandonment on Sphagnum re- colonization. We inventoried the vegetation structure in all trenches (2571) and baulks (2595) of abandoned block-cut areas as well as in all vacuum fields (395) of the mechanically mined areas. We also conducted detailed species releves in 242 of these peat fields. In comparison to vacuum-mined peatlands, block-cut peatlands regenerated remarkably well. Approximately 80% of all baulks and trenches in block-cut peatlands had 50% or higher cover of ericaceous shrubs compared with only 16% found on vacuum fields. Herb cover in the three types of abandoned fields was similar to that in natural peatlands. However, Sphagnum percent cover was below 2% in baulks and vacuum fields and was 30% on average in the trenches, which is clearly below cover estimates in natural peatlands. Sphagnum cover and richness were both higher in trenches with thin residual peat deposit, and Sphagnum richness increased with latitude. Our sur- veys revealed that abandoned mined peatlands have a high diversity of peatland vascular plants species and a low di- versity of non-peatland species.",,,Sphagnum; Tracheobionta; MinEd; Peat; Spontaneous order; Estimated,,1/5/2005,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,appendix,article,no,NA,Map,"c. 15 mosses, c.20 lichens, c.70 other plant species",1994-1997,source publication text,3,no,10000,no,abundance,,,,Canadian Journal of Botany,,,frequency data

After species description in 1835, it was first collected in the Izu Islands in 1877, with breeding first noted in 1901. Over the 20th century, murrelets were found breeding at 11 islands (i. e., Udonejima, Niijima, Shikinejima, Hanshima, Kozushima, Onbasejima, Tadanaejima, Sanbondake, Motone, Kojine, and Torishima) and were not thought to breed at 7 islands (i. e., Oshima, Toshima, Jinaijima, Miyakejima, Mikurajima, Hachijojima, and Hachijokojima). Surveys have not been conducted at 7 islands (i. e., Zenisu, Inanbajima, Aogashima, Beyoneizu-Retsugan, Myojinsho, Sumisujima, and Sofugan). The population is centered in the northern Izu Islands between Udonejima and Sanbondake. Once considered the world stronghold for the species, a large population decline apparently occurred in the mid-late 20th century: a) breeding no longer occurs at Shikinejima and Kozushima; b)some breeding habitat has been lost at Sanbondake; c)large numbers of nests reported by egg harvesters at Udonejima, Hanshima, and Sanbondake in early century no longer occur; and d)murrelets were observed less frequently on ferry trips between Oshima and Niijima in 1990-95 than in 1983-89. Current breeding population size appears to range between 350-850 breeding pairs(~7-43% of the global population estimated between 4,000-10,000 birds or 2,0005,000 pairs). Major colonies occur at Tadanaejima (100-300 pairs), Onbasejima (75-150 pairs),and Sanbondake(75-100 pairs), plus 20-30 pairs at Kojine.

Then, ordinations based on tree diameter distributions were used to study shifts in species composition in relation to time since the last fire. Even under similar abiotic conditions, successional pathways are numerous. However, regardless of forest composition after fire, most stands show convergence toward dominance of Thuja occidentalis and Picea mariana on xeric sites and dominance of Abies balsamea and Thuja occidentalis on more mesic sites. Stable communities of >300 yr occur on xeric sites while on mesic sites directional succession still occurs after 224 yr. Nearly all species involved in succession are present in the first 50 yr following fire. Only Abies balsamea and Thuja occidentalis increase significantly in frequency during succession. Following initial establishment, successional processes can generally be explained by species longevity and shade tolerance. Early successional species may be abundant in the canopy for more than 200 yr while the rapid decrease of Picea glauca, a late successional species could be related to spruce budworm outbreaks. Considering the short fire rotation observed (about 150 yr), a steady-state forest is unlikely to occur under natural conditions, though it may be possible if fire is controlled.",,,Command & Conquer:Yuri's Revenge; Succession; Immune Tolerance; Abies; Community; Picea; Zero suppression; Steady state; Diameter (qualifier value); Thuja; Greater Than; Motorola Canopy,,2004,,7,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,c.8 tree species,,,,,,,,,,,Vegetatio,1988,,

Cuttings were sampled monthly from May through October and rooted in a greenhouse. Root number and length of the longest root per cutting were determined 35 days after planting. There were significant variations among the six sampling dates in the rooting potential of cuttings of both species. A higher percentage of cuttings formed adventitious roots in May and June before or shortly after bud break than later, during the growing season; root number and length followed a similar trend. There was an increase in the rooting ability of cuttings of both species towards the fall period.

We tested Krecker's model (1939) which states that the abundance of invertebrates per unit macrophyte biomass varies with plant species and is higher on plants with finely dissected leaves than on plants with broad leaves. The abundance of invertebrates was measured in thirteen lacustrine macrophyte beds in southern Quebec, Canada. The model was tested for the total abundance of invertebrates and for the abundances of Chironomidae, Cladocera, Cyclopoida, Gastropoda, Hydracarina, Ostracoda and Trichoptera. 
 
 
 
2. More epiphytic invertebrates were found on the dissected Myriophyllum spp. than on the broad-leaved Potamogeton amplifolius Tuckerm, P. robbinsii Oakes and Vallisneria americana Michx. (P<0.01). More invertebrates were also found on P. amplifolius than on P. robbinsii or V. americana (P<0.01). The total abundance of invertebrates was not systematically related to the degree of plant dissection. 
 
 
 
3. The abundances of Chironomidae, Cladocera, Cyclopoida, Gastropoda, Hydracarina, Ostracoda and Trichoptera varied on different plant species (P<0.01). Contrary to Krecker's hypothesis, however, macrophytes with finely dissected leaves (Ceratophyllum demersum and Myriophyllum spp.) did not in general support more invertebrates per unit plant biomass than plants with large leaves (Potamogeton amplifolius, P. robbinsii and Vallisneria americana).",,,,,1/12/1988,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,geographic feature,NA,,c. 15 macrophyte species,1984,source publication text,<1,no,no,NA,presence-only,,,,Freshwater Biology,,,

https://doi.org/10.4296/cwrj2802301,The Development and Application of Multimetric Indices for the Assessment of Impacts to Fish Assemblages in Large Rivers: A Review of Current Science and Applications,"The biological assessment of lotic resources in much of the U.S. and Canada initially focused on wadeable rivers and streams. However, increased emphasis is being placed on larger, non-wadeable rivers. Many of these efforts include the development of multimetric indices represented by the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) following the original developmental work in the U.S. They include the pioneering work in the Wabash River of the Midwestern U.S., the inland rivers of Ohio and Wisconsin, the Ohio River mainstem, large western rivers and Quebec rivers, all of which focused on the fish assemblage. Monitoring fish assemblages in large rivers includes logistical and technical considerations that affect obtaining reliable estimates of relative abundance for all species that are amenable to efficient capture. A single gear approach is preferred for practical reasons and electrofishing is the sampling method of choice. Sampling effort is expressed in terms of distance sampled at a site and includes formulas based on fixed distances or multiples of river channel width. Relative abundance data are analyzed via multimetric indices (e.g., Index of Biotic Integrity), which are contingent on the development of a reference condition that supports a derivation and calibration process. Defining reference for large rivers represents a different challenge than with smaller, wadeable streams. For the latter, sufficient and suitable reference analogs usually exist, thus reference condition can be empirically derived. However, such analogs are either rare or do not adequately reflect the restorable potential for large rivers. Thus in developing the expectations that are necessary for metric calibration and IBI development, adequate historical knowledge of the assemblage is critical. Once developed, the metrics and indices provide meaningful measures of assemblage quality and response to chemical, physical, and biological influences and perturbations. This has been demonstrated for a wide variety of human impacts including water pollution, habitat and flow alterations, and land use changes. Successfully applying this protocol to large rivers involves taking the correct sequence of steps in the initial development of sampling and assessment methodologies. The IBI serves not only as an important benchmark of aquatic resource quality and condition, but also as a test of the significance of human impact on the aquatic environment. Developing and implementing a multimetric approach for large, coldwater rivers is feasible and would serve as a useful assessment and planning tool for determining the magnitude and severity of impacts from riverine flow and habitat modifications.",,,,,1/1/2003,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,other,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Calculation of indices

The eastern oyster has been called the ultimate estuarine animal. It can tolerate a wide range of salinity, temperature, turbidity and dissolved oxygen levels, making it well adapted to the ever-changing conditions of the estuary. The distribution and survival of eastern oysters within habitat types is influenced by abiotic (non-living, physical) factors such as salinity, tide, oxygen levels and flow, as well as biotic (living, biological) factors such as disease, shell erosion caused by other species and predation.

https://doi.org/10.1515/botm.1983.26.7.317,The Effect of Light on the Vertical Structure of Epibenthic Diatom Communities,"The development of an epibenthic diatom Community was observed using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on samples obtained from plastic panels immersed vertically at two depths in the St. Lawrence Estuary, Quebec. Live cell Immigration, cell velocity and growth form were investigated using glass slides. Some panels were either maintained at a constant depth (l or 5 m), exposed to normal daylight, or maintained shaded at the same depths. Others were transferred from l to 5 m from 5 to l m after initial colonization had occurred. Quantitative evaluations of diatom populations were made at weekly intervals. Results show that species composition, cell abundance and vertical stratification were dependent on depth and ultimately on light intensity. At all depths, newly immersed panels were mainly colonized by highly modle diatoms like Navicula spp. After six weeks of immersion, the Community from l m depth had developed into a distinctly two-layered algal mal. The upper stratum was characterized by filamentous (Melosira, Fragilaria) and branched tube-dwelling forms (Berkeleya), together with highly motile Nitzschia and Navicula. The lower stratum consisted of cells more closely associated with the substratum such √§s the slowly moving Cocconeis, erect fan-shaped Synedra and arborescent Gomphonema. After eight weeks of immersion, the uppermnost stratum peeled off and only the understory remained. In comparison with diatom colonies on panels directly exposed to sunlight, colonies on shaded panels from l m and unshaded panels from 5 m depths had a slower development, lower cell densities and were less stratified. Diatom assemblages observed on shaded ( I m ) and deeper water (less illuminated, 5 m) panels were very similar to the diatom layer intimately in contact with the substratum observed at l m depth. Species densities on panels transferred from l to 5 m and vice versa indicated that the dominance pattern was not related to differential Immigration but to growth (light) conditions. The vertical structure of the Community and diversity of growth forms were closely related to light availability.

https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3922,The effects of allospecific mitochondrial genome on the fitness of northern redbelly dace (Chrosomus eos),"Abstract Instantaneous mitochondrial introgression events allow the disentangling of the effects of hybridization from those of allospecific mtDNA. Such process frequently occurred in the fish Chrosomus eos, resulting in cybrid individuals composed of a C. eos nuclear genome but with a C. neogaeus mtDNA. This provides a valuable model to address the fundamental question: How well do introgressed individuals perform in their native environment? We infer where de novo production of cybrids occurred to discriminate native environments from those colonized by cybrids in 25 sites from two regions (West‚ÄêQc and East‚ÄêQc) in Quebec (Canada). We then compared the relative abundance of wild types and cybrids as a measure integrating both fitness and de novo production of cybrids. According to mtDNA variation, 12 introgression events are required to explain the diversity of cybrids. Five cybrid lineages could not be associated with in situ introgression events. This includes one haplotype carried by 93% of the cybrids expected to have colonized West‚ÄêQc. These cybrids also displayed a nearly complete allopatric distribution with wild types. We still inferred de novo production of cybrids at seven sites, that accounted for 70% of the cybrids in East‚ÄêQc. Wild‚Äêtype and cybrid individuals coexist in all East‚ÄêQc sites while cybrids were less abundant. Allopatry of cybrids restricted to the postglacial expansion suggests the existence of higher fitness for cybrids in specific conditions, allowing for the colonization of different environments and expanding the species‚Äô range. However, allospecific mtDNA does not provide a higher fitness to cybrids in their native environment compared to wild types, making the success of an introgressed lineage uncertain.",,,"DNA, Mitochondrial; Chrosomus eos x Chrosomus neogaeus; Mitochondrial Diseases; Crossbreeding; Inference; Dace",,19/2/2018,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,article,article,site coordinates,NA,Map,Chrosomus eos,no,NA,no,NA,25000,no,abundance,,,,Ecology and Evolution,,,
https://doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1005894525278,The effects of climate change on landscape diversity: an example in Ontario forests,"The predicted increase in climate warming will have profound impacts on forest ecosystems and landscapes in Canada because of increased temperature, and altered disturbance regimes. Climate change is predicted to be variable within Canada, and to cause considerable weather variability among years. Under a 2 √ó CO2 scenario, fire weather index (FWI) is predicted to rise over much of Ontario by 1.5 to 2 times. FWI may actually fall slightly, compared to current values, in central eastern Ontario (Abitibi), but for central-south Ontario it is expected to rise sharply by as much as 5 times current values. We predict that the combination of temperature rise and greater than average fire occurrence will result in a shrinkage of area covered by boreal forest towards the north and east; that some form of Great Lakes forest type will occupy most of central Ontario following the 5 C isotherm north; that pyrophilic species will become most common, especially jack pine and aspen; that patch sizes will initially decrease then expand resulting in considerable homogenization of forest landscapes; that there will be little 'old-growth' forest; and that landscape disequilibrium will be enhanced. If climate change occurs as rapidly as is predicted, then some species particularly those with heavy seeds may not be able to respond to the rapid changes and local extinctions are expected. Anthropogenically-altered species compositions in current forests, coupled with fire suppression over the past 50 years, may lead to forest landscapes that are different then were seen in the Holocene period, as described by paleoecological reconstructions. In particular, forests dominated by white pine in the south and black spruce in the middle north may not be common. Wildlife species that respond at the landscape level, i.e., those with body sizes >1 kg, will be most affected by changes in landscape structure. In particular we expect moose and caribou populations to decline significantly, while white-tailed deer will likely become abundant across Ontario and Quebec.",,,Spatial variability; Forests; Contour line; Picea; Moose (Perl); Zero suppression; Tail; Reindeer; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Population; Composition; Jack Device Component,,1/2/1998,,5,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ontario

Our study describes windthrow dynamics at a landscape scale of the Quebec North Shore region, Canada, and evaluates the effect of some site (soil surface material thickness or deposit thickness, drainage, slope, topography and wind), and stand (dominant species, height and density) characteristics on windthrow probabilities. The SIFORT database, created by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife of Quebec, the Quebec forest fire control agency and the Quebec forest pest and disease control agency, was used to perform a spatiotemporal analysis of windthrow, according to site and stand characteristics. Windthrow probabilities were influenced by topographic exposure (topex), slope classes and deposit thickness. Windthrow probabilities increased with topographic exposure. Windthrow occurrence was highest when deposit was thick (more than 1m) and slope class was medium (from 15 to 30 per cent). Finally, this study has shown the importance of partial windthrow at the landscape scale in the North Shore region. Thus our results suggest that from an ecosystem management perspective, clear-cutting must be partly replaced by partial cuts, in order to emulate the regional dynamics of partial windthrow.",,,,,1/4/2013,,7,semantic_scholar,,,,other,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,windthow
https://doi.org/10.4039/n04-055,"The effects of urbanization on ant assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) associated with the Molson Nature Reserve, Quebec","Abstract Urbanization causes the fragmentation of natural habitats into isolated patches surrounded by anthropogenic habitats. Fragment size and the intensity of human disturbance have been shown to affect both composition and diversity of arthropod communities, but most groups have been understudied. We investigated effects of urbanization on ant assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in and around the Molson Reserve, a preserved maple-beech forest surrounded by residential properties near Montr√©al, Quebec. We studied how local ant assemblages differed in terms of composition, abundance, and species richness, depending on whether they were situated in the interior forest, in adjacent residential backyards, or at the edge between these two habitats. We also compared an intact forest interior with a younger and moderately disturbed forest (‚Äúbuffer zone‚Äù) between the urban matrix and the interior forest. Few differences were detected between the buffer zone and the intact forest interior. Extrapolated estimates of species richness suggest that it is lowest in the forest interior and highest in urban zones. Community composition, as investigated with ordination analysis, revealed a clear difference between the fauna of urban sites and the fauna of edges and forest interiors, and analyzing the relative abundance of ants showed residential backyards to contain the most ants. Urban assemblages were characterized by several competitively dominant species, including one introduced or ‚Äútramp‚Äù species. The occurrence of aggressive and dominant species in urban sites and at the edges of the Molson Reserve could potentially interfere with the dispersal and immigration of ground-dwelling arthropods and negatively affect local diversity or community composition in isolated forest reserves in urban centres.

https://doi.org/10.1675/063.035.0403,The Importance of Agricultural Landscapes as Key Nesting Habitats for the American Black Duck in Maritime Canada,"Abstract. 
 Given historical patterns of decline, the American Black Duck (Anas rubripes) has long been a species of concern. To support the identification of core Maritime habitat, the distribution of breeding ducks was mapped at the landscape scale through the combination of GIS-based land cover information and five years of intensive aerial surveys (2006‚Äì2010). A predictive, mixed effects model was used to generate the maps, based on the weighted average of coefficients for the top 95% of all-possible models (as measured by AIC weights). The results of the averaged mixed model indicated that annual variation (YEAR), availability of surface water (WET_AREA, LAKE_AREA and WET_DIVERSITY) and occurrence of active agricultural landscapes (AG_PROP and ROAD_DENSITY) were strongly associated with the number of breeding pairs. The presence of larger numbers of breeding ducks in agricultural landscapes represents a departure from studies conducted in more intensively utilized regions (e.g. southern Ontario and Quebec), and suggest that the benefits of breeding in Maritime agricultural areas outweigh potential costs. Using 34,659 prediction points, duck distribution was modeled in relatively high and low years (2008 and 2006, respectively), resulting in detailed maps suitable for the identification of priority areas for habitat restoration and enhancement. In order to help refine conservation management plans, future work should more closely examine the impact of different types and combinations of Maritime agricultural production to better understand the way these landscapes attract breeding ducks.",,,,,1/12/2012,,5,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,BioOne,2012,,
https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1200279,"The importance of ecological constraints on the control of multi-species treeline dynamics in eastern Nunavik, Quebec.","UNLABELLED



PREMISE OF THE STUDY
Treelines are temperature-sensitive ecotones that should be able to expand in response to global warming; however, they are also controlled by ecological constraints. These constraints can create bottlenecks for tree regeneration, hindering treeline advances. Near Kangiqsualujjuaq (Nunavik, subarctic Qu√©bec), previous studies suggested successful recruitment of Larix laricina above the altitudinal treeline, while Picea mariana establishment remains scarce. We studied regeneration of both species to identify factors responsible for such contrasting responses. ‚Ä¢


METHODS
We measured seeds and wings to evaluate species dispersal potential. We compared seed viability and tolerance to shrub leachates with germination trials. To evaluate seedbed preferences, we compared seedling occurrence on the different seedbeds with seedbed relative abundance in the field. ‚Ä¢


KEY RESULTS
Seed germination was similar between L. laricina and P. mariana, whereas dispersal potential was higher for the latter. Germination of P. mariana seeds was more strongly inhibited by shrub leachates than were L. laricina seeds. In the field, we found only a few Picea seedlings, but numerous seedlings of Larix had established disproportionally on several seedbeds. While Betula glandulosa, mosses, and Vaccinium uliginosim impeded Larix establishment, numerous seedlings were found on lichens, mineral soil, and liverworts. The low occurrence of suitable seedbeds for Picea, mainly mineral soil, could explain the seedling scarcity of this species. ‚Ä¢


CONCLUSIONS
This study highlighted that allelopathy and unsuitable seedbeds could contribute to regeneration failure of P. mariana in eastern Nunavik and emphasizes the need to consider ecological preferences of species before predicting treeline expansion under a warmer climate.",,,Lichen - organism; Numerous; Plant seeds; Picea; Marchantiophyta; Germination; Allelopathy; Mosses; Natural regeneration; Betula Genus; Larix; Vaccinium; Seedlings,,1/10/2012,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,X,,,,,,5 tree spcies,,,,,,,,,,,American Journal of Botany,2012,,non-relevant information
,"The Odonata of Hamilton Marsh, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada","Specimen and sight records of Odonata from Hamilton Marsh, a small wetland on the east coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, are presented. Thirtythree species representing 14 genera and five families are listed. The biogeography of the fauna is discussed -the site lies at a crossroads of several faunal elements -and notes on behaviour, ecology, habitat structure and succession are included. Study area Hamilton Marsh (49o19‚Äô20‚ÄùN, 124o29‚Äô10‚ÄùW) is located 5 km south of Qualicum Beach, Vancouver Island, British Columbia (Figure 1). It is about 0.5 km wide and 3 km long. A small stream, locally known as Hamilton Creek, flows through the marsh and into French Creek, which empties into the Strait of Georgia. Hamilton Marsh is located in the Georgia Depression Ecoprovince (MEIDINGER & POJAR, 1991). Both peatland and mineral wetlands are common in this area of the province‚Äôs south coast (MACKENZIE & MORAN, 2004), but peatlands are rare in the Nanaimo Lowland Ecosection where Hamilton Marsh is located. The study site lies within the Moist Maritime Subzone of the Coastal Douglas-fir Biogeoclimatic Zone (COUSENS et al., 1996). This biogeoclimatic zone is restricted to low elevation (<150m) coastal areas in the rain shadow of the Vancouver Island Ranges. The climate is Mediterranean, characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Hamilton Marsh is a combination of several wetland habitats (Figure 2). COUSENS et al. (1996) described it as 20% shrub swamp; a band of Salix and Spiraea douglasii Hook. rings the wetland adjacent to the forest. Another 20% of the wetland is open water (<2 m deep) near the outlet. The plant community here is dominated by Nuphar lutea (L.) Sm., Brasenia schreberi Gmel. and Menyanthes trifoliata L. The remaining 60% is marsh, comprised of floating peat, root mats and associated plants; considerable open water occurs early in the year. Although the wetland is best classified overall as a marsh or marsh/shallow water complex, it has some fen characteristics -peat, aquatic mosses and other peatland plants are common. Several species of sedge form extensive beds along parts of the shore or extend into the marsh -Carex cusickii Mackenzie ex Piper & Beattie, C. interior Bailey, C. lanuginosa Michx., and C. sitchensis Prescott ex Bong. Other characteristic species are Comarum palustre (L.) Scop., Dulichium arundinaceum (L.) Britt. and Sphagnum squarrosum Crome. At the edge of the forest, Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud., Spiraea douglasii Hooker and Malus fusca (Raf.) Schneid. are common. The surrounding second growth forest is dominated by Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don, Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sargent, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco and Alnus rubra Bong. (CANNINGS, 2005). Two beaver dams at the outlets of the marsh account for its present high water mark of 88.75 m above sea level, recorded in 1995. This reading has not changed significantly since a 1981 survey. Low summer water levels range from 20 to 30 cm below the high water mark. This water level decline is the result of seepage, evaporation and annual irrigation use under a water license in effect since 1956. The total volume is estimated at 200,000 m; the volume below the high water mark is 170,000 m. During the summer, the declining water levels expose much of the dominant Menyanthes trifoliata and Carex spp. vegetation and may even expose the peat and root mat. Rapid succession is occurring; almost 100% of the marsh was open water in 1954, but only 20% or less of the area was open water in 1994 (COUSENS et al., 1996). From 1850 to 1950 much of the forest around the marsh was logged. Between 1940 and 1950, attempts were made to farm beaver and muskrat. To do this, established beaver dams were destroyed and ditches dug to further drain the wetland. After these efforts failed, the owner of the wetland tried to raise American Bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana Shaw) and Northern Leopard Frogs (Rana pipiens Schreber). To this day, a breeding population of bullfrogs remains. Collections and other data Many of the specimens from the marsh were collected by R.A. Cannings at various times and are housed in the Royal British Columbia Museum (RBCM) in Victoria, BC. Other significant collections were made by G.E. Hutchings and are in his collection in Victoria. The site was visited by participants in the 2000 Dragonfly Society of the America‚Äôs field meeting on 29 July 2000 (HUTCHINGS, 2000). However, the only intensive study on the Odonata is that of SIMAIKA (2005), which looked at the relationships among dragonflies and plants over a four-month period. Most of the records from the above collections are summarized in the present work, but the data are not intended to be comprehensive. In addition, some larvae and exuviae occur in these collections, but we have not analyzed these and do not report on them herein. Plant names follow DOUGLAS et al. (2001). Faunal elements Species may be grouped with others that share similar distributions to form what can be termed faunal elements. The following classification is modified from PORSILD (1958) and SCUDDER (1979) and is used in the annotated list below to indicate the ranges of individual species. Those elements relevant to the study area are: 1) Boreal -species occurring in the northern spruce (Picea) forests, across the boreal zone from treeline to the southern margin. In general, these species range from the Atlantic Provinces across the northern New England states, Quebec, northern Ontario, parts of the northern tier of mid-western states, the Prairie Provinces north of the Great Plains, and northern British Columbia, often ranging considerably southward in the higher mountains and plateaus of the western Cordillera. 2) Transition -species generally most common in the southern boreal forests and adjacent montane forests in the West and mixed and deciduous forests in the East. 3) Cordilleran -species confined to the western mountains and their intervening valleys and plateaus. 4) Pacific Coastal ‚Äì species confined to the lowlands of the Pacific Coast. 5) Western -species confined to west of the 100th meridian, but otherwise ranging widely in North America. 6) Austral -species transcontinental in the southern part of North America and, at the northern extremities of their ranges, entering Canada to varying degrees along the international boundary. 7) Widespread -species with broad distributions in North America, from north to south and east to west, overlapping several of the other elements listed. These species range into boreal regions to varying degrees. Annotated list of species LESTIDAE Lestes congener Hagen Faunal element: Widespread 18-VI (2004) to 9-X (1988). A few tenerals on 29-VII-2000; pairs in tandem 09-VIII (2004) to 14-VIII (2004); copulation from 9-VIII (2004) to 9-X (1988). On average, this is the latest Lestes to emerge in BC and the latest to fly in the autumn; emergence before early July is unusual and adults often fly well into November (CANNINGS, 2002). Lestes disjunctus Selys Faunal element: Widespread 29-VI (1981) to 25-VIII (1990); copulation from 12-VII (2004) to 25-VIII (1990); oviposition from 12-VII (2004) to 30-VIII (2004). L. disjunctus is the most common lestid at Hamilton Marsh. Pairs evidently oviposited on only Carex lanuginosa and Juncus arcticus. On C. lanuginosa they oviposited into fresh stems, low above the water surface; on J. arcticus, eggs were placed into dead tissue about 10cm from tip of stem. Lestes dryas Kirby Faunal element: Widespread (Holarctic) 18-VI (2004) to 21-VII (2004). This is the least common Lestes at Hamilton Marsh and the first one to emerge in the year. Lestes forcipatus Rambur Faunal element: Austral 18-V (2004) to 4-IX (2004); copulation from 28-VI (2004) to 16-VIII (1986); oviposition 12-VII (2004) to 14VIII (2004). Part of Simaika‚Äôs 2004 study (SIMAIKA, 2005) examined the sympatry of L. forcipatus and L. disjunctus. Patterns of pruinescence are the best characters for distinguishing males of these two similar species in the field (SIMAIKA & CANNINGS, 2004). Throughout most of BC, at least, male L. disjunctus has the top of abdominal segment 2 completely covered with pruinescence while that of L. forcipatus has the apical third bare. Because acetone damages these patterns on Lestes and other species, we recommend that the usual acetone treatment not be used on species with pruinescence. Unlike Lestes disjunctus, L. forcipatus prefers to oviposit in the living stems of Juncus arcticus. The species will also lay eggs in Carex lanuginosa and Menyanthes trifoliata. COENAGRIONIDAE Enallagma boreale Selys Faunal element: Boreal 18-V (2004) to 25-VIII (1990); in tandem 29-VII (2000); copulation from 18-V (2004) to 15-VIII (1986). E. boreale is the most common Enallagma at the site. Enallagma carunculatum Morse Faunal element: Austral 20-VII-1986. Enallagma cyathigerum (Charpentier) Faunal element: Boreal 21-VII (2004) to 18-VIII (1984); in tandem 21-VII (2004). Ischnura cervula Selys Faunal element: Cordilleran 18-V (2004) to 25-VIII (1990); in tandem 29-VII (2000). This is a common species at Hamilton Marsh, and one of the earliest odonates to appear in spring. Ischnura erratica Calvert Faunal element: Pacific Coastal 18-V (2004) to 15-VI (1996). This Ischnura is probably more abundant than the few collections suggest; flies early in the season and disappears before most visits were made to the marsh. Ischnura perparva Selys Faunal element: Western 18-V (2004) to 21-VIII (1990). The pruinose females, ovipositing alone, are much more conspicuous than the more delicate males. AESHNIDAE Aeshna canadensis Walker Faunal element: Transition 15-VI (1995) to 9-X (1988). A. canadensis is perhaps the most common Aeshna at Hamiliton Marsh in midsummer. Aeshna eremita Scudder Faunal element: Boreal 15-VI (1995). This Aeshna usually prefers lakeshores with less dense aquatic vegetation than occurs at Hamilton Marsh; the site is not typical of the",,,,,2006,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,British Columbia

The small wolf C. priscolatrans(= C. edwardii) of the early Irvingtonian seems unrelated to the modern red wolf (C. rufus), but gave rise to a lineage including the larger C. armbrusteri and culminating in C. dirus of the late Rancholabrean. A small wolf, possibly a descendant of the Eurasian C. mosbachensis, did not reappear in the east until near the end of the Rancholabrean. At the same time, the coyote (C. latrans) disappeared from the east, not to return until the small wolf was extirpated in the 20th century. Fragmentary remains of the small wolf, dating from around 10,000 and 2,000-200 ybp, show continuity with 14 complete, mostly modern, eastern skulls. Multivariate analysis indicates those 14 represent a well-defined species, C. rufus, distinct from large series of the western gray wolf (C. lupus) and coyote. There is no evidence that the red wolf originated as a hybrid of the latter two species, though early specimens from central Texas suggest it began to interbreed with C. latrans by about 1900. Three long-recognized red wolf subspecies appear valid: C. r. floridanus, Maine to Florida; C. r. gregoryi, south-central United States; and C. r. rufus, central and coastal Texas, southern Louisiana, and probably now represented in the captive/reintroduced populations. The subspecies C. lupus lycaon of southeastern Ontario and southern Quebec is statistically intermediate to C. rufus and western C. lupus, and may have resulted from natural hybridization of those two species. Such could explain how the red and gray wolf differ so sharply where their ranges meet in the west but morphologically approach one another in the east.",,,"Lupus Vulgaris; Lineage (evolution); Subspecies; Scott continuity; Coyotes; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Crossbreeding; Captive portal; Lakes of Wada; Specimen; Wolves; Large; Population",,1/6/2002,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,USA
https://doi.org/10.2307/2261594,The Relationship of Vegetation to Methane Emission and Hydrochemical Gradients in Northern Peatlands,"1 The bryophyte and vascular flora were described for a range of forested and open peatlands in the mid-boreal Clay Belt region of Canada, and in the subarctic region of the Labrador Trough, Quebec. The floristic patterns and their relationships to methane (CH4) emission, hydrology and water chemistry were analysed with classification (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). 2 Despite differences in vegetation physiognomy, chemistry, and geology, water chemistry (pH, Ca, Mg, Kcorr) and hydrology explain most of the species distribution in both peatland regions. In the Clay Belt, bryophytes respond primarily to water table position, and secondarily to water chemistry; the reverse is true for the vascular flora. The bryophyte and vascular ordinations are more similar to each other in the Labrador Trough than in boreal sites. 3 Although CH4 emissions are lower in subarctic than in boreal sites, mean CH4 flux is strongly correlated with mean water table position (r2 = 0.73) in both regions, but is not correlated with water chemistry. The highest CH4 emissions (seasonal mean > 100mg m-2 day-') occur in raised bog and patterned poor fen pools where the peat mat is degrading. 4 The relationships among CH4 flux, mean water table position, and species distribution are similar in both boreal and subarctic regions. Bryophytes are generally better predictors of CH4 flux than vascular plants, except for certain species in flooded sites (e.g. Carex spp.). Bryophytes are also better indicators of the long-term average position of the water table, reflecting relative zones of methane production and oxidation over the season. In the vascular plant analyses, shrub cover indicates dry conditions and low CH4 flux in the sharply differentiated string-flark-pool topography of the subarctic fens, but is less predictive of CH4 emission in the drier hummockhollow microtopography at boreal sites where shrubs and trees are more pervasive. Overall herbaceous or sedge cover is not indicative of CH4 flux in either region.",,,,,1/6/1995,,7,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,appendix,article,no,NA,"Map, site coordinates, administrative unit, geographic feature",c.20 plant species ,1992,source publication text,,no,no,NA,abundance,,,,Journal of Ecology,,,The only spatial information is a very large geographic extension (Labrador trough)

https://doi.org/10.2317/JKES100322.1,Tipula oleracea Linnaeus in West-Central California (Diptera: Tipulidae),"Occurrence of certain European species of crane flies of the genus Tipula on coastal North America has been known for a hundred years or more. A. H. Swinton (1909) reported a single female of Tipula oleracea Linnaeus from Cape Race, southeasternmost Newfoundland. But C.P. Alexander (1942) supposed it was more likely the very similar Tipula paludosa Meigen, which has been subsequently recorded from Newfoundland and nearby Nova Scotia. The most likely explanation for the occurrence of either species on the eastern coast of North America is that immature forms ‚Äì larvae and possibly eggs or pupae, for all occur in soil, near the surface ‚Äì were transported in soil used as ballast in European commercial vessels (Fox, 1952). The soil was abandoned on shores near harbors and replaced by cargo destined for Europe. How either T. paludosa or T. oleracea reached the western coast of North America probably involved similar transportation of immatures. The species have spread into interior eastern North America, and have recently been reported from Michigan (Gelhaus, 2005), interior New York (Peck et al., 2006), Ontario (Peck and Olmstead, 2009), and Quebec (Taschereau et al., 2009). There is no mention of either T. paludosa or T. oleracea in C. P. Alexander‚Äôs publications on the crane flies of Washington (1949) or Oregon (1954). In his section on Tipulidae, in the Catalog of the Diptera of America North of Mexico(Stone et al., 1965), he listed only T. paludosa and only from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. In his major work on the crane flies of California (1967:56), Alexander mentioned that T. paludosa had been found in British Columbia and seemed to be established there. He added ‚Äò‚ÄòThe species is of considerable economic importance and, unless the outbreak is controlled, may well be expected to spread southwards in the west, possibly to California.‚Äô‚Äô As Alexander predicted, T. paludosa has, in the years since 1967, been reported from near the coasts of both Washington and Oregon. Occasional specimens of both T. paludosa and T. oleracea have, in the past 20 years, been sent to GWB for identification. Recognition of these European immigrants has been facilitated by reference to the well illustrated work of E. N. Savchenko (1961), based in part on earlier works by B. Mannheims (1952) in Germany, and R. L. Coe (1950) in Britain. Commencing in 2002, co-author Arnaud (PHA) has sent numerous specimens of T. oleracea, among other Tipulidae, collected in the vicinity of San Francisco, California, to GWB for identification. As far as we are aware, these comprise the first major, long-term collections of that species from California. Umble and Rao (2004) recorded 27 specimens of T. oleracea from three counties in extreme northwestern California and mentioned that PHA had found the species in the vicinity of San Francisco Bay. San Francisco is approximately 270 miles (435 km) south of the collection sites in northwestern California. Using mainly his own modification of Malaise traps but also collecting off walls near lights, etc., PHA has collected T. oleracea throughout the years 2003‚Äì2009, in six counties of central, near-coastal California. The species is clearly established in that area and has become so common that numerous individuals have been captured in each of those years. So far, however, we have not heard of any reports of damage to grasslands in the area. In all, 1036 individuals (581 males, 450 females, 5 damaged) of T. oleracea were captured during this study. Collections were made in Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties, around the southern San Francisco Bay, Monterey Co., somewhat south of these, and Marin Co. to the northwest. More than one-third of the specimens were collected by PHA at and near his home in suburban South San Fransisco, San Mateo County. The species was taken in every month of the year, at one of these sites or another. There were no peaks of abundance suggesting the number of generations per year. Most of the flies, however, were collected in April through August. Dates for trap collections are not precise because traps were not checked daily. The crane flies were initially preserved in small, glassine envelopes.",,,,,26/10/2011,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,California
,Title : Discovery of Internal Standards for the Determination of Limonene in Sweet Orange ( Citus Sinensis ) Oil by Gas Chromatography,"Glasses doped with rare-earth ions are of interest materials in several hightechnological and environmental applications. Study of optical absorption near the fundamental absorption edge is a useful method for the investigation of optically-induced transitions, band structure and the optical band gap in glasses. We prepared bismuth borotellurite glasses doped with Sm3+ and Eu3+ ions by varying TeO2/ Bi2O3 content. By taking appropriate amounts of TeO2, Bi2O3, B2O3 and Sm2O3/ Eu2O3, glasses were prepared by melt quench technique. The raw materials were melted in a furnace around 900¬∞ C and the melt was quenched on a brass plate. The glasses thus produced were annealed to remove thermal strains by placing in a tubular furnace at 300¬∞ C for 3 hours. The glass samples were smoothed and polished using an Inland Swap Top Machine. Optical absorption measurements were carried out using a UV-VIS absorption spectrometer. Using Mott-Davis model, the optical band-gaps and the type of transitions near the fundamental absorption edge were determined from the absorption edge data which lies in the wavelength range 350 to 450 nm. The optical band gap of these glasses is found to remain constant with increase of TeO2 content and the absorption edge is mainly due to direct forbidden transition for Sm doped glasses and indirect allowed transition for Eu doped glasses. 36. Title: Detection Probability and Disturbance of Waterfowl During Aerial Surveys Principal presenter: Andrew Gilbert Major: Biology Faculty mentor: Dr. Christopher N. Jacques Abstract: Aerial waterfowl surveys have been conducted in the Illinois and Mississippi River floodplains since 1948. These traditional surveys provide an index of waterfowl population size and are used to track migration events, set harvest regulations, and for research purposes. New methods are being evaluated to estimate population size by randomizing survey locations and estimating count bias. We used double sampling to determine a correction factor for waterfowl estimates during fall aerial surveys. Immediately before an aerial survey, a ground observer surveyed waterfowl in predetermined locations from an elevated, unobstructed location where probability of detection was assumed to be 100%. Aerial counts were divided by ground counts for all common species and foraging guilds to determine count bias. Preliminary results indicate that mean detection rate for all waterfowl was 96.0% (SE=7%). Mean detection rate was 94.4% (SE=8%) for ducks, 105.2% (SE=11%) for dabbling ducks, 74.8% (SE=11%) for diving ducks, 53.3% (SE=8%) for mergansers, and 92.4% (SE=9%) for geese. Observers also documented disturbance to waterfowl caused by aerial surveys. Preliminary findings indicated 18.4% (SE=2%) of waterfowl, 12.2% (SE=2%) of ducks, 11.5% (SE=2%) of dabbling ducks, 4.5% (SE=1%) of diving ducks, 13.0% (SE=3%) of mergansers, and 28.6% (SE=4%) of geese exhibited negative responses (i.e., flew short distances, swam away, changed behavior significantly) to aerial surveys. Preliminary findings indicated that 5.5% (SE=2%) of waterfowl, 2.0% (SE=1%) of ducks, 1.2% (SE=1%) of dabbling ducks, 0.7% (SE=1%) of diving ducks, 4.3% (SE=1%) of mergansers, and 15.1% (SE=3%) of geese abandoned survey sites and did not return following aerial surveys. With our findings, traditional aerial surveys conducted in the Mississippi and Illinois River floodplains can be adjusted for count bias and compared with population estimates from randomized surveys to compare cost and time efficiency of aerial survey techniques. 37. Title: Prevalence of Ectoparasites and Strongyloides Robustus in Southern Flying Squirrels (Glaucomys Volans) in West-Central Illinois Principal presenter: Beth Scheihing Major: Biology Other presenters or co-authors: Will T. Rechkemmer, Sean E. Jenkins, Bridget M. Walker, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, Shelli A. Dubay, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, and Christopher N. Jacques Faculty mentor: Dr. Christopher N. Jacques Abstract: Parasites can have long-term negative fitness consequences for host organisms. The degree to which parasites may affect populations of host species may depend on a variety of factors including the host species itself and the ability of parasites to move between host organisms. Southern flying squirrels (SFS; Glaucomys volans) commonly occurs in all wooded habitats and has an eastern distribution south of the Great Lakes that extends up the east coast into southernmost Quebec. Nevertheless, a paucity of information on SFS parasitic diseases across Midwestern landscapes. Strongyloides robustus is an intestinal nematode that infects SFS and its congener (i.e., northern flying squirrel; G. sabrinus), though infection is more prevalent in the southern species, which commonly acts as a reservoir for infection. Infection with S. robustus also could be influenced by other parasites (e.g., ectoparasites) which could potentially increase susceptibility to S. robustus. Thus, the primary objectives of our study were to 1) determine prevalence and intensity of infection of SFS with S. robustus, and 2) determine the diversity of ectoparasites in SFS across west-central Illinois. Because of the unique landscape characteristics (e.g., high forest fragmentation) across the Midwest, population and disease dynamics of SFS may vary relative to other landscapes characterized by more contiguous forests. A total of 51 SFS were examined for ectoparasites, of which 25 (49%) were infected. Mean intensity was 4.12 ectoparasites per host. Preliminary results also indicate that 80% (n = 10) of SFS were infected with S. robustus. Our study is the first documentation of ectoparasites in SFS across Midwestern landscapes, which may assist with understanding ecological factors contributing to infection with S. robustus, and in turn assist with geographic prioritization of future SFS conservation efforts. 38. Title: The Examination of Time on Task Behaviors of Students with Disabilities in a Motor Clinic as a Result of the ExerciseBuddy Application Principal presenter: Lauren L. Brozman Major: Sport Management Faculty mentor: Dr. Cynthia Piletic Abstract: The Adapted Physical Activity Motor Clinic hosts students from the West Central Illinois Special Education Cooperative (WCISEC) on Friday mornings throughout each Fall and Spring Semester. The Adapted Physical Activity Motor Clinic has been an ongoing experience for Western Illinois students for approximately 16 years. The motor clinic is a learning environment for Physical Education teacher candidates, Communication and Speech Disorder graduate students, Special Education teacher candidates, and Education teacher candidates who are asked to educate and interact with students from the WCISEC. The WCISEC students range in age from 3 21 years . This learning experience gives Western Illinois students the unique opportunity to see development in the WCISEC students while also collaborating with other future professionals in an interdisciplinary/cross departmental experience. During the clinic time is divided between an on-land portion, where the students are active in the Brophy Hall gymnasium and swimming portion where students learn aquatic skills in the Brophy Hall swimming pool. The lessons plans are initially created by the physical education teacher candidates with professional input from the instructors of the kinesiology course and other future professionals working directly with the WCISEC students. The ExerciseBuddy application is used on an iPad to display a visual representation of the content that is verbally and physically being instructed by the physical education teacher candidates. For the purpose of the clinic Western Illinois students were encouraged to use the ExerciseBuddy application during their warm-up and throughout the lesson if it pertained to the objectives of the lesson plan. The application is an electronic visual board, that incorporates components of fitness training to communicate: expectations, repetitions, and body movements. The purpose of the study is to examine how the ExerciseBuddy application impacts the time on task of students with autism and intellectual disabilities. Data collection included recording the teaching sessions of the WCISEC students while participating in the gymnasium portion that focus on fundamental motor skills, sport skills, and lifelong leisure activities. Recordings of the students were collected while they participated in motor activities three consecutive semesters. The data collected observed groups of students (3-7 per group); individual student's performance with the application was not taken into account for the purpose of this study. Data analysis is completed by reviewing the digital recordings with a computer software systematic analysis tool known as SOFIT. SOFIT, was used to observe the recording once the semester(s) had concluded. The specific elements reported included: (a) level of physical activity, (b) session content, (c) instructor interaction and (d) instructor involvement. Significance of the research will impact the multiple professions, including physical educators, that come into contact and work with people with different types of disabilities and impairments. It is hypothesized that the results will indicate when using a smart tablet, paired with the visual component of Exercise Buddy it will aid in students' success towards meeting the objectives of the lesson 39.

In this work we simulated the change in bird species richness in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada, under climate change scenarios. To do so, we first analyzed which geographical and bioclimatic variables were the strongest predictors for the spatial distribution of the current resident bird species. Based on canonical redundancy analysis and analysis of variance, we found that annual temperature range, average temperature of the cold season, seasonality of precipitation, precipitation in the wettest season, elevation, and local percentage of wet area had the strongest influence on the species‚Äô distributions. We used these variables with Random Forests, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Maximum Entropy models to explain spatial variations in species abundance. Future species distributions were calculated by replacing present climatic variables with projections under different climate change pathways. Subsequently, maps of species richness change were produced. The results showed a northward expansion of areas of highest species richness towards the center of the province. Species are also likely to appear near James Bay and Ungava Bay, where rapid climate change is expected.",,,Map; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Random forest; Ecosystem; Seasonality,,22/8/2018,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,X,,,,,,c.30 bird species,,,,,,,,,,,International Journal of Geoinformation,2018,,"only a list of species provided, without spatial reference"

Tree-ring chronologies of the host species, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), were constructed to identify periods of severe defoliation and comparisons were made with tree-ring chronologies of nonhost species. In addition, the frequency of white and narrow rings was used to further confirm the occurrence of insect outbreaks at these latitudes. Some major outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony at the regional scale, but the initiation year, intensity, and extent of the outbreaks varied spatially. For example, the 1950s outbreaks were observed from 1951 to 1952 at 46¬∞N, from 1953 to 1954 at 47¬∞N, and from 1954 to 1956 at 48¬∞N.

,Using bird survey data to associate habitat type and bird species richness in a forest of southern Quebec,"Introduction The effects of habitat on biodiversity have been studied extensively. Species richness is a basic measure of diversity and can be a proxy for ecosystem health (Mitchell 2006). Birds are plentiful, diverse and identifiable to the trained ear, making them a useful umbrella or indicator taxa for biodiversity studies. Habitat largely determines breeding bird distribution as it dictates two fundamental needs: an acceptable nesting site and an ample food supply (Vickery and Arlettaz 2012). According to previous studies of bird species richness, a habitat‚Äôs structural diversity, or the number and varieties of nesting and feeding niches, is positively correlated to its avian species richness (Cody 1985).

,"VALIDATION TESTS OF AN AMPHIBIAN CALL COUNT SURVEY TECHNIQUE IN ONTARIO, CANADA","Amphibian call count surveys in Ontario use a common survey protocol. We evalu- ated the precision and accuracy of data collected by these methods. Multiple observers monitored the same routes to determine inter-observer variation. Inter-observer agreement in evaluation of calling intensity and occurrence was generally high, and the experience of the observer affected estimation of both calling intensity and the number of individuals calling. There was no significant increase in inter-observer agreement in evaluation of calling intensity or occurrence with 5-min versus 3-min surveys. Longer surveys rarely resulted in the identification of species not heard in the first 3 min. Surveys of 30-60 min duration indicated that return for effort declined sharply during the second minute of the survey, although new species were sometimes heard after as long as 15 min. Simultaneous intensive and extensive monitoring was performed on populations of Fow- ler's toads (Bufo fowleri) in southern Ontario and bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) in central Ontario to determine whether there was a relationship between calling intensity and chorus size or population size. We found a linear relationship between call counts and chorus size in both species. We conclude that the data generated with the call count surveys were adequately precise, but accuracy remains to be validated. Further investigation of the relationships among population size, chorus size, calling intensity, and environmental factors are required to determine whether extensive monitoring of calling amphibians can be used as an index of actual population size. However, until that time, we recommend that calling amphibian surveys be used as the first part of an integrated program using extensive monitoring to identify areas where populations may be declining, and intensive monitoring to confirm or refute reports of declines. EXTENSIVE monitoring programs using volunteer observers in conjunction with professional biologists are currently being used in Canada and the United States in an attempt to detect fluctuations and trends in both the abundance and distri- bution of amphibian populations using standardized techniques. Amphibian call count surveys have been implemented in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatche- wan, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Mich- igan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minne- sota, Missouri, and Iowa. The amphibian call count protocol used in Ontario is a point-count method that relies primarily upon the efforts of volunteer observers. Three-minute surveys are conducted along routes consisting of up to 10 permanently marked stations. Because of the difficulty of estimating distance in the dark, no at- tempt is made to limit the calls counted to a fixed distance around each survey point. Stations are set at intervals of at least 500 m to minimize the risk of counting indi- viduals more than once. Surveys begin 0.5 h after sunset and are completed no later than midnight. Each route is surveyed three times during the spring and early summer, with the dates of surveys depend- ing on the latitude of the route. Ontario has been divided into north, central, and south regions demarcated at the 43rd and 47th degrees of latitude. The three survey periods are 15 days in dura- tion and are set a minimum of 15 days apart. Participants are asked to survey dur- ing specific weather conditions. Minimum air temperatures for surveying are 8 C (first survey), 13 C (second survey), and 21 C (third survey).

Location: Bas-Saint-Laurent region, southeastern Qu√©bec, Canada. Methods: Data (species assemblages, abiotic and spatio-historical variables) were collected in 16 bogs ranging from 2 to 189 ha, and incorporated in a geographical information system. Major gradients in vegetation composition were identified using DCA. CCA was used to relate vegetation gradients to abiotic and spatio-historical variables. Results: A clear segregation of species assemblages was observed, from open and undisturbed bogs to forested and highly disturbed sites. Among abiotic factors, tree basal area, water table level and peat thickness had a significant influence on plant species composition. Among spatio-historical factors, disturbance level, area loss and fire were the most influential factors. Variance partitioning between these groups of factors suggests that spatio-historical factors had a major influence on peatlands, representing 22% of the variation observed in the plant species assemblages while abiotic factors represent only 17% of the variation. Conclusions: The results highlight the influence of agricultural and other anthropogenic activities on plant assemblages and suggest that even wetlands apparently resistant to disturbances, such as peatlands, can be severely affected by anthropogenic factors. Plant species assemblages of ombrotrophic peatlands of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region were, and still are, largely influenced by human activities. Nomenclature: Anderson et al.

After an outbreak of insect pests in 1996, a study of insect groups that may include potential pests or beneficial species was initiated. This article reports on the weevil diversity and abundance during three consecutive years of sampling (1997‚Äì1999) in two vineyards. All weevils were collected using pitfall and flight intercept traps. In total, 3,176 specimens were collected, representing 73 species in three families of Curculionoidea. The family Curculionidae was the most species rich, especially the subfamilies Ceutorhynchinae, Curculioninae, and Entiminae. Four of the species recorded are known to feed on the genus Vitis (Vitaceae) in North America: Madarellus undulatus (Say), Barypeithes pellucidus (Boheman), Otiorhynchus ovatus (L.), and Otiorhynchus sulcatus (F.). Of these, O. sulcatus is thought to represent the greatest potential threat based on adult abundance at one of the sites and the negative impact of this species in other wine-making regions in North America. Four species [Ceutorhynchus oregonensis Dietz, Pelenomus waltoni (Boheman), Rhinoncus perpendicularis (Reiche), and Sphenophorus minimus Hart] are recorded in Quebec for the first time.

https://doi.org/10.1645/GE-2874.1,Widespread Dispersal of Borrelia burgdorferi‚ÄìInfected Ticks Collected from Songbirds Across Canada,"abstract:‚ÄÉ Millions of Lyme disease vector ticks are dispersed annually by songbirds across Canada, but often overlooked as the source of infection. For clarity on vector distribution, we sampled 481 ticks (12 species and 3 undetermined ticks) from 211 songbirds (42 species/subspecies) nationwide. Using PCR, 52 (29.5%) of 176 Ixodes ticks tested were positive for the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. Immature blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, collected from infested songbirds had a B. burgdorferi infection prevalence of 36% (larvae, 48%; nymphs, 31%). Notably, Ixodes affinis is reported in Canada for the first time and, similarly, Ixodes auritulus for the initial time in the Yukon. Firsts for bird-parasitizing ticks include I. scapularis in Quebec and Saskatchewan. We provide the first records of 3 tick species cofeeding on passerines (song sparrow, Swainson's thrush). New host records reveal I. scapularis on the blackpoll warbler and Nashville warbler. We furnish the following first Canadian reports of B. burgdorferi‚Äìpositive ticks: I. scapularis on chipping sparrow, house wren, indigo bunting; I. auritulus on Bewick's wren; and I. spinipalpis on a Bewick's wren and song sparrow. First records of B. burgdorferi‚Äìinfected ticks on songbirds include the following: the rabbit-associated tick, Ixodes dentatus, in western Canada; I. scapularis in Quebec, Saskatchewan, northern New Brunswick, northern Ontario; and Ixodes spinipalpis (collected in British Columbia). The presence of B. burgdorferi in Ixodes larvae suggests reservoir competency in 9 passerines (Bewick's wren, common yellowthroat, dark-eyed junco, Oregon junco, red-winged blackbird, song sparrow, Swainson's thrush, swamp sparrow, and white-throated sparrow). We report transstadial transmission (larva to nymph) of B. burgdorferi in I. auritulus. Data suggest a possible 4-tick, i.e., I. angustus, I. auritulus, I. pacificus, and I. spinipalpis, enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Our results suggest that songbirds infested with B. burgdorferi‚Äìinfected ticks have the potential to start new tick populations endemic for Lyme disease. Because songbirds disperse B. burgdorferi‚Äìinfected ticks outside their anticipated range, health-care providers are advised that people can contract Lyme disease locally without any history of travel.",,,Ticks; Indigofera; Oral candidiasis; Subspecies; Dimercaprol; Passeridae; Songbirds; Larva; Nymph; Borrelia burgdorferi,,1/3/2012,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,BioOne,2012,,

In that period, 16 states in the USA (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, Wyoming) and two provinces in Canada (Ontario, Quebec) were visited. Seven wild and weedy Lactuca species (L. serriola, L. saligna, L. virosa, L. canadensis, L. biennis, L. floridana, L. ludoviciana), an interspecific hybrid (L. canadensis¬†√ó¬†L. ludoviciana), and an undetermined Lactuca species were recorded, and 343 seed samples were collected from 200 locations. The largest number of wild Lactuca species that we observed was recorded in Iowa, and the largest number of samples was collected in California. The most common habitats of weedy species (L. serriola, L. saligna and L. virosa) were along transport corridors, such as roadsides, road ditches, parking sites and petrol stations, grassy slopes and ruderal places. The most frequent species was L. serriola, an Old World introduction, which we observed in all states and provinces visited, except for New York, and in broad range of elevations (up to 2,358¬†m a.s.l.). Lactuca saligna was recorded only one time in Salinas, California. Lactuca virosa was found repeatedly in Washington State along the road to the Mt. St. Helens and in Redwoods, California. Native North American taxa (L. canadensis, L. floridana, L. ludoviciana) were recorded only in Iowa. Lactuca biennis was found only in Canada in the southern part of Quebec. Records of diseases and pests showed only occasional occurrences of downy mildew (Bremia lactucae) and powdery mildew (Golovinomyces cichoracearum). Most plant-disease findings were made in Canada. Results of these efforts enrich our knowledge of the distribution, ecogeography and ecobiology of Lactuca species occurring spontaneously in North America.

https://doi.org/10.1890/06-1056.1,Zooplankton biodiversity and lake trophic state: explanations invoking resource abundance and distribution.,"While empirical studies linking biodiversity to local environmental gradients have emphasized the importance of lake trophic status (related to primary productivity), theoretical studies have implicated resource spatial heterogeneity and resource relative ratios as mechanisms behind these biodiversity patterns. To test the feasibility of these mechanisms in natural aquatic systems, the biodiversity of crustacean zooplankton communities along gradients of total phosphorus (TP) as well as the vertical heterogeneity and relative abundance of their phytoplankton resources were assessed in 18 lakes in Quebec, Canada. Zooplankton community richness was regressed against TP, the spatial distribution of phytoplankton spectral groups, and the relative biomass of spectral groups. Since species richness does not adequately capture ecological function and life history of different taxa, features which are important for mechanistic theories, relationships between zooplankton functional diversity (FD) and resource conditions were examined. Zooplankton species richness showed the previously established tendency to a unimodal relationship with TP, but functional diversity declined linearly over the same gradient. Changes in zooplankton functional diversity could be attributed to changes in both the spatial distribution and type of phytoplankton resource. In the studied lakes, spatial heterogeneity of phytoplankton groups declined with TP, even while biomass of all groups increased. Zooplankton functional diversity was positively related to increased heterogeneity in cyanobacteria spatial distribution. However, a smaller amount of variation in functional diversity was also positively related to the ratio of biomass in diatoms/chrysophytes to cyanobacteria. In all observed relationships, a greater variation of functional diversity than species richness measures was explained by measured factors, suggesting that functional measures of zooplankton communities will benefit ecological research attempting to identify mechanisms behind environmental gradients affecting diversity.",,,Community; Small; Diatoms; Cyanobacteria; Phytoplankton; explanation; Phosphorus; Zooplankton; Gradient; Subphylum Crustacea; Chrysophyta,,1/7/2007,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,zooplankton community,,,,,,,,,,,Ecology,2007,,they have data in Figshare repository but it is only code

Studies around the world have evaluated the succession of arthropods on animal carcasses, but no published data are available for the province of Quebec (Canada). The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity of arthropods associated with pig carcasses in Quebec, and to determine the colonization sequence of the different families/species throughout the decomposition process. Three pig carcasses were deposited in a small woodland area in Trois-Rivi√®res, in mid-June 2019. The decomposition process and the arthropod community were studied until the beginning of November (first snowfall) by visual observation, and sample collection on the carcasses, using an entomological net and pitfall traps. Five species of blow fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae) were found to lay eggs on the carcasses: Calliphora livida, C. vomitoria, Lucilia illustris, Phormia regina, and Protophormia terraenovae. Eggs/larvae of the first three species were recorded during the first week only (fresh stage-beginning of active decay), while the other two species were recorded throughout the decomposition process until the dry remains stage. Coleoptera were observed from day 0 to day 141 (end of experiment). Some families/species were associated with early stages of decomposition (e.g. Necrophila americana, Silphidae), while others were only found during the dry remains stage (e.g. Carnicops pumilio, Histeridae).",,,,,2020,,9,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,No dataset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cuttings collected in August, during the active growing season, did not perform as well as those collected in June, October, or February. The only performance variables influenced by plant gender were root number and shoot biomass, for which female cuttings were superior to males. Surprisingly, the application of indole-3-butyric acid inhibited adventitious root and lateral shoot number and biomass, particularly at the highest concentration (10 000 mg¬∑L -1 ). Increased nutrient availability enhanced root, but not shoot, growth.

Recent studies have documented cases of stx carriage in other Shigella species, including S. sonnei linked to travel to Morocco (Nyholm et al. 2015) and S. flexneri with travel history to Caribbean (Gray et al. 2014, 2015). In the province of Quebec, more than 40% of Shigellosis cases are travel-related (Trepanier et al. 2014). Therefore, a retrospective laboratory study was performed by the Laboratoire de sante publique du Quebec to assess the presence of stx gene among the 210 strains of Shigella isolated between 2013 and 2014. The collection included 131 S. sonnei ,7 5S. flexneri ,3 S. boydii, and 1 S. dysenteriae type 12. Polymerase chain reaction targeting genes stx1 and stx2 was performed according to the methods of Paton and Paton (1998). Three isolates of S. flexneri isolated from stool were positive for the stx1 gene and belonged to serotype 2a (n = 2) and serotype y (n = 1).

We carried out a side by side comparative evaluation of the performance of Bruker Biotyper versus VITEK MS for identification of a large and diverse collection of microorganisms. Most difficult and/or unusual microorganisms, as well as commonly encountered microorganisms were selected, including Gram-positive and negative bacteria, mycobacteria, actinomycetes, yeasts and filamentous fungi. Six hundred forty two strains representing 159 genera and 441 species from clinical specimens previously identified at the Laboratoire de sant√© publique du Qu√©bec (LSPQ) by reference methods were retrospectively chosen for the study.

Of the 70 strains not present in the Bruker database at the species level, the Biotyper correctly identified 10 (14.3%) to the genus level and 2 (2.9%) to the complex/group level. For 52 (74.2%) strains, we obtained no identification, and an incorrect identification was given for 6 (8.6%) strains. Of the 178 strains not present in the VITEK MS IVD database at the species level (excluding 71 untested mycobacteria and actinomycetes), the VITEK MS correctly identified 12 (6.8%) of the strains each to the genus and to the complex/group level. For 97 (54.5%) strains, no identification was given and for 69 (38.7%) strains, an incorrect identification was obtained. Our study demonstrates that both systems gave a high level (above 85%) of correct identification for a wide range of microorganisms. However, VITEK MS gave more misidentification when the microorganism analysed was not present in the database, compared to Bruker Biotyper. This should be taken into account when this technology is used alone for microorganism identification in a public health laboratory, where isolates received are often difficult to identify and/or unusual microorganisms.",,,,,2015,,9,semantic_scholar,,,,non-field experiment,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PLoS ONE,,,

From the collection of 22,409 identifiable specimens, 28 species and four associations representing 12 genera and one group of drepanodontiform elements are documented and their stratigraphic ranges established. One new genus, Rexroadus, is established for two species earlier assigned with question to Oulodus. New species described are Icriodella dicrana, Oulodus sigmoideus, Ozarkodina strena, and Pterospathodus? originalis. The fauna is dominated by species of Ozarkodina and Oulodus; many species have a first appearance that is slightly older than elsewhere suggesting that the Anticosti Basin may have been an important evolutionary radiative center in the early Silurian. There is a slow and progressive diversity increase in conodonts through this interval after the initial appearance of many new taxa in the basal Silurian following the mass extinction in the terminal Ordovician. The Anticosti Llandovery sequence represents one of the few highly fossiliferous, continuous successions in the world and a new conodont biozonation based on conodonts for the Llandovery is proposed with the following interval zones in ascending order: Ozarkodina hassi (new), Ozarkodina strena (new) [subdivided into Oulodus jeannae (new) and Oulodus panuarensis (new) subzones], Ozarkodina clavula (new), Ozarkodina aldridgei (new), Pterospathodus celloni, and Pterospathodus amorphognathoides zones.",,,,,2002,,9,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of Paleontology,,,

Characteristic zigzag defoliation was reported in the province of Qu√©bec, Canada, on the community science website, iNaturalist. Field trips conducted to the site resulted in the collection of live specimens (a few larvae and a cocoon from which an adult emerged) and onsite observation of diagnostic defoliation and empty cocoons, confirming the presence of this exotic species in Canada. Subsequent inspection of elm trees by naturalists and scientists in the south of the province led to the conclusion that the species is more widely distributed than first expected and that the invasion is not localised to a small area. Preliminary genetic data pointed to a possible European origin of the Canadian population, but conclusive assignment to source will require examination of more specimens and the collection of reference sequences from different European and Asian populations.

One basic premise of dendroclimatology is that tree rings can be viewed as climate proxies, i.e. rings are assumed to contain some hidden information about past climate. From a statistical perspective, this extraction problem can be understood as the search of a hidden variable which represents the common signal within a collection of tree-ring width series. Classical average-based techniques used in dendrochronology have been applied to estimate the mean behavior of this latent variable. Still, depending on tree species, regional factors and statistical methods, a precise quantification of uncertainties associated to the hidden variable distribution is difficult to assess. To model the error propagation throughout the extraction procedure, we propose and study a Bayesian hierarchical model that focuses on extracting an inter-annual high frequency signal. Our method is applied to black spruce (Picea mariana) tree-rings recorded in Northern Quebec and compared to a classical average-based techniques used by dendrochronologists (Cook and Kairiukstis, 1992).",,,,,2009,,9,semantic_scholar,,,,non-field experiment,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a single female specimen identified by Hurd in 1954 as X. varipuncta Patton, 1879 from British Columbia is in the C.A. Triplehorn Insect Collection at The Ohio State University (OSUC), suggesting that this species was accidentally introduced into coastal western Canada. As wood-nesters, many large carpenter bees are likely capable of expanding their range great distances by natural and unnatural transport methods while nesting inside suitable substrates, the presumed mode of transport into western Canada, and likely elsewhere. The ease at which the nests are transported has likely contributed to the nomenclatural and distributional ambiguity surrounding this species due to morphological similarities of specimens from North America, Hawaii, and several South Pacific islands. New information By comparing DNA barcodes of specimens from the western United States to specimens from Hawaii, we confirm the early opinion of P.H. Timberlake (Timberlake 1922) that specimens long established on the Hawaiian Islands are the same X. varipuncta from continental North America. Furthermore, these DNA barcode sequences also match those of specimens identified as X. sonorina Smith, 1874 from the French Polynesian and Samoan Islands, thus fully supporting the opinion of Groom et al. (2017) that all are likely conspecific. As X. sonorina, a species described from and likely introduced to Hawaii is the oldest name available, X. varipuncta is here placed into synonymy. Additional research will be needed to trace the timing and pathway of introduction and establishment of X. sonorina; it is presumed that the species is native to the southwestern United States but has been established in Hawaii since the mid-1800s. It is also established in French Polynesia, the Samoan Islands, and likely other south Pacific islands, with additional records of occurrence from Java, New Zealand, and now Canada.",,,,,2020,,9,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Biodiversity Data Journal,,,

Sixty-two samples were collected from the Table Head and Long Point groups, western Newfoundland, the Jolliet Group, Anticosti Island, and the Trenton Group, St. Lawrence Lowlands. These yielded over 2600 moderately to well-preserved ostracodes. The Carter Collection, an existing collection of ostracodes from the Lowlands, was also examined. During the research, a series of difficulties were encountered in obtaining the faunas, interpreting their taxonomy, and understanding their paleoenvironmental implications. -- In the sections studied, Ordovician ostracodes occurred sporadically and were often rare or absent. All the collections were obtained by washing soft shales or by vibra-tool preparation of indurate limestones; selection of samples that can be readily processed is essential. Ordovician ostracode taxonomy is often confusing; many species are narrowly defined and allow little morphological variation. In this study, the taxonomy of a number of species is revised and a number of existing species are re-interpreted as synonyms. Fifty-four species representing forty genera are described and illustrated. No new species are established, because the current species are either already described in the literature, or could only be identified at the generic level because of a lack of well-preserved material. -- Although faunal composition, abundance and diversity arc directly influenced by the paleoenvironment, it is difficult to develop ostracode-based criteria for the elucidation of Ordovician paleoenvironments. Observations made during this study indicate that sea-level changes and water depth were strong controls on the nature of Ordovician ostracode faunas. In the Lourdes Formation, western Newfoundland and the Ellis Bay Formation, Anticosti Island, marked increases in faunal diversity and the rates of speciation can be directly correlated with transgressive events that increased the shelf area and the variety of niches available. Water depth, through its control of a variety of interdependent ecological factors, such as water temperature, food supply and substrate, was also an important influence on the type of ostracode community present. A series of depth-related communities are tentatively recognised. High- energy, nearshore environments tend to have a high-abundance, low-diversity fauna consisting of large, robust, smooth ostracodes; speciation rates are low and the community structure is relatively stable. Stable, open shelf, carbonate environments tend to have high-diversity faunas, consisting of a wide variety of ornamented forms such as Eurychilina subradiata and Foramenella phippsi; speciation rates are high and the community structure frequently changes. Outer shelf to shelf-slope environments tend to have a low-diversity, low-abundance fauna consisting of drepanellids such as Warthinia nodosa and smooth-elongate ostracodes like Phelobythocypris cylindrica; speciation rates are low and the community structure is stable. As depth increases and the shelf-slope transition is crossed, faunal abundance and diversity diminish rapidly and in situ ostracode faunas disappear altogether. -- Effective use of Ordovician ostracodes as biostratigraphic indicators, depends on their ability to cross facies and provincial boundaries. At present it is not possible to make more than crude correlations, because the faunas are not well enough known. A few of the species, such as Eurychilina subradiata and Tetradella quadrilirata, are wide ranging and have obvious potential for correlating Ordovician shelf sediments. Many other species cannot be used for inter- or intra-regional correlation, because they are locally endemic, occurring in some areas, but not in others.",,,,,1991,,9,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explore, in this study, the possibility of using an electronic tool to monitor occurrence of the tick vector of Lyme disease, Ixodes scapularis. The study aimed to compare the capacity for ticks to be identified in web-based submissions of digital images/photographs, to the traditional specimen-based identification method used by the provincial public health laboratory in Quebec, Canada. Forty-one veterinary clinics participated in the study by submitting digital images of ticks collected from pets via a website for image-based identification by an entomologist. The tick specimens were then sent to the provincial public health laboratory to be identified by the ‚Äògold standard‚Äô method using a microscope. Of the images submitted online, 74¬∑3% (284/382) were considered of high-enough quality to allow identification. The laboratory identified 382 tick specimens from seven different species, with I. scapularis representing 76% of the total submissions. Of the 284 ticks suitable for image-based species identification, 276 (97¬∑2%) were correctly identified (Kappa statistic of 0¬∑92, Z = 15¬∑46, P < 0¬∑001).

Four of these lineages are regionally restricted in their range while the fifth lineage, comprising two‚Äêthirds of all specimens, has emerged in recent times and exhibits a recent demographic expansion with rapid spread across the Canadian range of its host. Four of these viral lineages are shown to circulate in the US. To explore the role of the big brown bat host in dissemination of these viral variants, the population structure of this species was explored using both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear microsatellite markers. These data suggest the existence of three subpopulations distributed in British Columbia, mid‚Äêwestern Canada (Alberta and Saskatchewan) and eastern Canada (Quebec and Ontario), respectively. We suggest that these three bat subpopulations may differ by their level of female phylopatry, which in turn affects the spread of rabies viruses.

Our overall goal was to test if soil perturbation and planting fast-growing species could promote the reestablishment of a relatively diverse plant community. A chronosequence that included three plantations (4, 8, and 12-year old) established after soil scarification, paired with three natural stands representative of the local temperate mixedwood forest comprising both pioneer and late-successional tree species, was implemented. Vegetation surveys and soil collection were performed in 2012 and species traits were provided by the Traits Of Plants In Canada and TRY databases. Principal response curve analyses showed species and functional trait divergence between treated and natural stands at ages 4 and 8, but that those divergences were less at age 12. Species and trait convergences were slower in the scarification furrows than in the scarification berms (mounds between furrows). However, severe site preparation did not appear to affect soil variables on the study sites. Our results suggest that even following severe site preparation, gradual recovery of species and trait composition similar to that of natural stands appears possible in the long term, mainly through fast canopy development by hybrid poplar. However, organic material export and soil erosion risks associated with this type of site preparation need to be evaluated.

Here in collaboration with a local oil recycling company (Qu√©bec, Canada), we assessed the biodiversity of bacteria and studied their ability to metabolize used engine oil (UEO). The bacterial species identified (Paenibacillus, Klebsiella, Micrococcus, Microbacterium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus and Stenotrophomonas) were similar to those found elsewhere in the world, including countries with much warmer climate than Canada (like China, India, and Egypt to name a few). This suggests that UEO as main carbon source -and not climateis determinant for the biodiversity on UEO collection sites. Many bacterial strains identified here resisted to exposure to UEO at higher concentration (20% v/v) than reported earlier. As observed in earlier reports for many bacteria under various growth conditions, bacteria screened from this UEO source were also able to produce an intracellular biopolymer that was identified as a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). We also identified an interesting consortium (composed of Stenotrophomonas and Rhodococcus) that metabolized UEO alkanes, and appeared suitable for two applications: bioremediation and biopolymer production. Under specific conditions, this same bacterial consortium secreted an elastomer-like biopolymer. The biopolymer formed at the surface of broth cultures where it was easily recovered. Based on FTIR analyses, the biopolymer was tentatively identified as ethylene propylene diene monomer (an EPDM rubber). To our knowledge, the conversion of UEO into an extracellular elastomer by bacteria has not been previously reported. Both species were found to be necessary for production of this biopolymer, suggesting a synergy among their respective metabolic machinery.",,,,,2018,,9,semantic_scholar,,,,non-relevant information,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spangler (1961) reviewed the distribution and biology of S. tessellata, recording it from the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Quebec as well as from localities throughout eastern United States. Smetana (1988), in his important review of the hydrophilidae of Canada, provides only three Canadian collection records for S. tessellata: one from Nova Scotia, one from Quebec and one from New Brunswick. roughley (1991) used Smetana‚Äôs review as the basis for a checklist of hydrophilidae of Canada, but gave the known Canadian distribution of S. tessellata as Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario instead of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Quebec. There are no Ontario specimens of S. tessellata in the Wallis-roughley Museum of Entomology (University of Manitoba) so roughley‚Äôs listing of Sperchopsis from Ontario was probably a lapsus. The relatively large (about 7 mm long), strikingly convex, pitted adults of this species are easily distinguished from other water scavenger beetles, so it is unlikely that it would be overlooked in collections or samples from aquatic insect surveys. The new Ontario records of Sperchopsis given below are based on the only known Ontario collections of the genus. I first collected and identified this species from Ontario in 1976, from the Credit river near Belfountain in Wellington County. Despite subsequent searching in apparently suitable parts of other streams and rivers in southern Ontario (including the Eramosa, Saugeen, Speed, Grand, Sauble, rankin and Crane rivers), no further Sperchopsis specimens were found until 2007 and 2008, when one beetle was found on rotting wood embedded in an undercut sandy bank in the Credit river near Erin, and another was collected in the Credit River very close to where the first Ontario specimen had been collected 31 years earlier.

Although this turfgrass species has desirable playing attributes, it suffers from susceptibility to environmental and biological stresses including subfreezing temperatures and snow molds. In this study, we compared 29 genotypes collected from golf greens located in Quebec and Ontario for their resistance to pink snow mold (SM). Plants were inoculated with Microdochium nivale [(Fries) Samuels & Hallett], causal agent of SM, and incubated under controlled conditions. High levels of variation in SM resistance were detected within the collection and between genotypes. Analysis of the relationship between climatic parameters at the sites of origin and SM susceptibility revealed that level of resistance was positively correlated to the duration of snow cover. Genetic diversity within the Poa collection was estimated using the sequence related amplifi ed polymorphism (SRAP) technique. The UPGMA (unweighted-pair group method arithmetic average) dendrogram yielded two main clusters that differed markedly in their proportion of SM-resistant genotypes. Our results show that SM disease is a major selection pressure for the generation of genetic diversity among annual bluegrass biotypes that evolved on golf greens in northern climates. SRAP polymorphisms between bulked genotypes with contrasting resistance to SM were identifi ed and could be used as markers for SM resistance in annual bluegrass.",,,,,2009,,9,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,L,article,.pdf,sample coordinates,NA,Map,Poa annua,no,NA,no,NA,no,NA,presence-only,,,,,,,

Ex Fr.) Pouzar as a natural means of controlling vegetative regrowth from stumps of native hardwoods is receiving increased attention in Canada (Gosselin 1996, Dumal et al. 1997, Shamoun and Hintz 1998). The technique involves treating freshly cut stumps with the mycelium of indigenous strains of this ubiquitous fungus. However, the deployment of fungal plant pathogens with wide host-ranges may have certain undesirable environmental side effects. These negative impacts may be linked, among others, to the introduction of new genetic material to local genepools and to increased post-treatment spore load. In addressing both of these topics, we assessed: i) the extent of genetic variability among Canadian populations of C. purpureum both within and between different ecozones, and ii) the possible post-treatment effect of an increased spore load on surrounding vegetation. To study the first point, a Qu√©bec collection of 43 isolates of C. purpureum, from 14 different host species in 3 forest zones, and 92 isolates sampled from four Canadian geographical regions were analyzed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (Williams et al 1990). For the latter collection, samples were grouped into four populations each corresponding to a Canadian ecozone (ecozones 1, 2, 4 and 5) as defined in the Canadian registration guidelines for microbial pest control agents (Anonymous 1998). This grouping is based on geological and ecological characteristics. For the Qu√©bec population, RAPD profiles of all primer-template combinations (7 primers) were visually compared. Variability was initially assessed within and between different collection sites, for samples from a given host species. The genetic variation among samples isolated from different host species was then assessed, regardless of collection site. For Canadian populations, 22 polymorphic amplicons generated by 4 primers were analysed. Genetic diversity estimates (Nei 1973) and an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) (Huff et al. 1994) were used to investigate population structure. Finally, the occurrence of C. purpureum sporophores was assessed along eight 1.6km transects radiating from 4 treatment sites. Transects had sampling plots at 200m or 400m intervals. Over a 3-year period, over 10,000 trees, including paper birch, the most susceptible species, were surveyed. In addition, the presence of the fungus was examined in tissue samples from 220 stumps trees (paper birch, aspen and pin cherry) cut when environmental conditions were favorable for spore release from treatment sites. RAPD markers diagnostic of the deployed strains were also developed to determine if detected infections were attributable to the treatment (Gosselin 1999). C. purpureum was found to be a highly heterogeneous pathogen with a continuously distributed population across Canada (Gst = 0.048). A maximum of 0.3% of nontarget trees examined bore C. purpureum sporophores; a level corresponding to natural occurrence of the fungus. All sporophores were associated with either injured or recently killed trees, or with fresh stumps. A higher mean level of disease (15%) occurred on the 220 stumps sampled, infection levels varied from 0 to 45% between plots. However, RAPD analysis showed that over 85% of the infections detected were attributable to naturally occurring inoculum while less than 2.3% of the stumps contained deployed strains. The occurrence of infection was not related to host species or to distance from treated site. These results underscore the importance of considering the population structure in the process of its registration and provide further knowledge to ascertain that the deployment of C. purpureum as a bioherbicide may provide considerable benefits with minimal risks to the environment.",,,,,2010,,9,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,No dataset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This majestic tree is threatened with elimination by an invasive species Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (HWA) Adelges tsugae introduced in the USA in 1924, which is believed to be a native of Asia. HWA reduces shoot growth, provokes branch dieback, and eventually tree death. One strategy to help mitigate the fast spread of HWA is to determine what may cause host potential resistance to HWA and how to use this information to develop HWA-resistant management program. This project was initiated to.... To do that, randomly selected trees have been studied in Allegheny National Forest in 2006 with monthly data collection by hand-held soil probe instruments measuring temperature and water content noting the time of sampling and also some of them have been instrumented with station recording equipment called Hobo with recorders inserted at 15 cm soil depth and collecting temperature and water content data continuously. Net N mineralization and net nitrification were calculated using the in situ incubation technique, in this method the values of extractable nitrate-N and ammonium-N in incubated soil are compared to the initial.

Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS with data collected, the main effects were thinning treatment (reference, thinning), soil pH, soil organic matter percentage, tree DBH, soil temperature, sampling months. The thinning (treatment) is statistically significant (p= 0.053). The thinned plots mineralize more total nitrogen, almost 10 mg/kg of soil, approximately 50% than the reference plots. Thus, the observed N mineralization rate for the growing season was 21.7 mg/kg to 30 cm soil depth in control plots, or 65.8 kg N/ha. The estimated rate of N mineralization in HWA-infested stands was 30 times the observed rate, reaching 1973 kg/ha. A series of spatial prediction maps of the landscape Nitrogen levels were created by using ArcGIS 9.2 software that helped acquire a spatial perspective of the soil N mineralization rates in forest ecosystems at a large scale. These spatial prediction maps will become increasingly important once the HWA infests the study site and will be visible impacts of N mineralization rates change in forest soil. By creating a data base before HWA infestation of the stand and continuing gathering data after HWA infestation, with the help of the nitrogen mineralization model we will be able to elucidate the stand nutrient vs. HWA cause and effect relationship. Nitrogen forms are an important water quality parameter, but in excess, it can be detrimental to waterways and their ecosystems. Enriched nutrient loads to streams may alter surface water quality and disrupt management of watersheds used by municipal treatment water. Nitrate and cations diffusion into the surface water can reduce its drinking quality. Blue-baby syndrome (Methemoglobinemia) can be caused by high nitrate found in drinking waters.",,,,,2010,,9,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Lidar sensor determines the distance and the position of an object, based on the time taken by a beam of light to reach the ground and to return to the sensor. Lidar has been successfully used in forestry studies because it results in a characterization of the structure of forest stands in three dimensions. Data collection is fast and non-intrusive. On the other hand, the fusion of Lidar data with multi-spectral data opens a large number of potential forestry applications because it provides information about the type of vegetation, the foliar density of trees, their phenology, as well as optical properties of certain species. The Financi√®re Agricole de Qu√©bec (FADQ) in association with the Laboratoire de g√©omatique agricole et appliqu√©e (GAAP), has used this technology to assess the yield and the quality of orchards in Qu√©bec. The present project aims at demonstrating the potential of Lidar and of multi-spectral data to show in 3D attributes of structure of individual apple trees such as the size of the crown and the estimation of the tree height. This then allows us to estimate the foliar biomass, the density of foliage and individual tree geo-positioning obtained by Lidar. The results of the tree counting and apple production estimations are compared with field data and with statistics from FADQ. The correlations are high, demonstrating that the Lidar method is able to accurately evaluate the production of apple orchards.",,,,,2008,,9,semantic_scholar,,,,non-relevant information,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the summer of 1982, Hans-Peter Schultze and Gloria Arratia were invited to a small museum located on a fossiliferous site of the Devonian Escuminac Formation in Miguasha, Quebec, eastern Canada, Hans-Peter was to work with Marius Arsenault, the director of the Miguasha Museum, on the skull of the elpistostegalid Elpistostege watsoni, a species closely related to basal tetrapod. In addition, he went through the collections to describe and measure numerous juvenile specimens of the osteolepiform. Eusthenopteran foordi. As expected, there two projects turned out to be important contributions in lower vertebrate paleontology and systematics: one on the origin of tetrapods (1985), and the second one on growth patterns of a Late Devonian fish (1984). During his visit to Miguasha, Hans-Peter also spent time digging for fossils and drawing numerous specimens in the collection. In addition, in order to help the personnel of the museum to identify some of the Escuminac fished, he created an identification key based on the gross morphology of the scales. For a small group of undergraduate students, hired at the museum during the summer as naturalists, it was a unique opportunity to discuss paleontology with a leading researcher. We were amazed by his willingness to talk to us, even if then most of us only spoke French! For the first time, we were exposed to Hennigian methodology and its usage in vertebrate paleontology during and evening lecture that Hans-Peter prepared for us. His lecture was delightful; it was an intensive course in lower vertebrate anatomy, and an intellectual journey among the philosophers Karl Marx and Karl Popper, the entomologists Willy Hennig and Lars Brundin, and ""The Band of Four"" (Rosen et al., 1981). It was for most of us our first exposure to science, as it should be done. We were all impressed by his knowledge and above all by his simplicity and friendliness. Two years later I started my Ph.D. at The University of Kansas, under the supervision of Hans-Peter. Compared to his long career, these two weeks that Hans-Peter spent in Miguasha represent an extremely shourt period of time. Some might say that this little anecdote is insignificant when introducing a vertebrate paleontologist (Fig. 1A) who published 132 paper and books (a total of 2977 published pages) in addition to more than 80 abstracts, book reviews and obituaries. However, this brief story is representative of Hans-Peter's personality and contributions. He is a great scientist with numerous interests in science, art, and history. Hans-Peter enjoys digging for fossils, looking at fossils and describing fossils, and he loves sharing his knowledge and experiences with people, independent of their academic training. doi: 10.1002/mmng.20020050102",,,,,2002,,9,semantic_scholar,,,,non biological,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within this sequence there lurks a tendency to move from prophetic overviews to empirically based modelling to policy implementation, but disparate assumptions by the individual authors give the reader the feeling of participating in a form of energy leap-frog. A successful interdisciplinary effort must establish sufficient common grounds of reference to compare and contrast ideas. Energy Policy: The Global Challenge, unfortunately, does not. Some quirks of omission in this long, fine-print collection may be apparent to some readers. Although one author introduces two species of energy policies as ""provincialis"" and ""federalis,"" the theme of federal and provincial conflicts over energy receives little attention. This oversight is magnified when coupled with the significant bypassing of energy problems and prospects in eastern Canada. Hydro power in Newfoundland and Labrador, the political and economic gate-keeping by Quebec, offshore oil and gas, and tidal power developments in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia do not receive detailed consideration. Of course, this oversight may well be symptomatic of Canadian national energy policy and perceptions. Fusion energy is a technology cited by several authors as capable of dramatically offsetting their predictions of energy needs and resources. Yet, perceptions of the feasibility of fusion are, at best, unclear. An article by a reputable physicist in nontechnical terms would have been useful to the discussion.

Although the mechanisms driving reproduction have been thoroughly investigated and discussed, their relative importance and possible coexistence remain an open question. Seed rain abundance and viability of balsam fir Abies balsamea, white spruce Picea glauca, and white birch Betula papyrifera were monitored during 1994‚Äì2007 along a chronosequence of developmental stages at different densities represented by four stands in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. The aim of the study was to verify whether seeding temporal dynamics and abundance were affected by stand density, and to test the causal relationships between the hypotheses of pollination efficiency and predator satiation. Seed rain abundance varied substantially among years and species, with the highest values being observed in 1994 and 1996, and attaining up to 28.2 ÓÄ≥ 103 seeds mÓÄ≤2 yearÓÄ≤1. However, the annual dynamics of seed production was similar in the three sites with the higher densities. The greater proportions of germinating and dead seeds were observed in white birch, while balsam fir showed an average of 11.2% of damaged seeds, which were infected by larvae. The conifer species had the higher proportions of empty seeds. The causal models tested on balsam fir demonstrated that seed rain abundance influenced the amount of both viable and larval-infected seeds, although no causal relationship existed between these last two variables. The comparable and synchronous seed rain abundances observed among sites demonstrated that stand density can significantly affect the reproduction of trees, probably by limiting the access to resources, but not the annual dynamics of seeding. Pollination efficiency and predator satiation are important forces in the reproductive effort of trees and could be not mutually exclusive because both these mechanisms of natural selection synergistically coexist in driving the seeding dynamics of balsam fir.",,,,,2012,,10,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,L,article,.pdf,no,NA,no,"Balsam fir, White spurce, White birch",1994,NA,no,NA,no,NA,abuncance,,,,,,,

Coloured or red (Vulpes vulpes) and arctic (Vulpes lagopus) foxes across northern Canada are considered to be the principal maintenance or reservoir hosts of rabies virus. Therefore, I studied the phylogeography of one host, the red fox, to better understand the movement of the host and compare it with virus variant distribution across the landscape. Many studies confirm the impacts of environmental changes, particularly climate change, on the migratory behaviors of both fox and rabies virus variants. Also, different geographical areas have different population densities of red and arctic foxes. This study focused on red foxes sampled from the areas of Montreal, Abitibi-Temiscamingue, James Bay, Kuujjuarapik, Umiujaq, Inukjuak, and Kuujjuaq in Quebec, and Labrador City, North West River, Port Hope Simpson and Cartwright in Labrador. A series of 15-loci microsatellite profiles were used to genetically characterize 396 foxes and determine their phylogeographic relationships with respect to the landscape. Microsatellite markers were assessed using Micro-Checker to test for null alleles, stuttering or large allele dropout. Linkage disequilibrium among all pairs of loci was evaluated with GenePop. Genetic diversity and F-statistics was measured by using Arlequin in both loci and populations. Population structure was investigated with pairwise FST measures, Analysis of Molecular Variance, and individual clustering methods such as STRUCTURE and Geneland. FIT was significant at four loci and FST was significant at all loci indicating that the loci selected are suitable for analysis. FIS was not significant in any populations. The conclusions from the phylogeographic analysis were that there are four genetic groups of red foxes in this region of Canada, consisting of one in the Montreal area, one in James Bay, and two segregating in northern Quebec and Labrador. The Abitibi region was a mixture of the Montreal and the James Bay clusters. When a northwestern locality, Churchill NB, was included and 9-locus genotypes used, there were three distinct clusters, with Churchill dominated by one, Montreal by another and a third northeastern group prevalent in northern Quebec and Labrador. James Bay was a mixture of the Churchill cluster and the northeastern one, Abitibi- Temiscamingue was a mixture of the Montreal and the Churchill clusters, and the Churchill cluster also spread into northern Quebec and Labrador. These results suggest routes by which rabies virus could be spread via red fox movement patterns, such as along the coast, or from north to south, but also suggests a possible barrier to movement further south than Montreal. This study is important because the rabies virus is still a relevant public health concern for Canadians and, as such, research contributing to its effective eradication and control is of great importance. The results from this study will be used to inform theoretical models to help predict future rabies virus transmission and spread.",,,,,2020,,10,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,X,article,.pdf,no,NA,administrative unit,"vulpes lagopus, vulpes vulpes",no,NA,no,NA,no,NA,presence-only,,,,,,,

Global warming during the 21st century could potentially increase local population densities and reinforce the pest status of this aphid in commercial fir (Abies Miller; Pinaceae) plantations in Qu√©bec, Canada. During this study, we tested the effects of a warmer environment on colony growth rates of M. abietinus and aphid morph composition during the second generation of its cycle, which is key to colony size growth and potential damage to Christmas trees. We monitored M. abietinus populations on two host fir species and one host fir variety, in order to understand the early season dynamics of this aphid and its host tree. It was possible to distinguish the two overlapping generations of winged aphids leaving colonies, which led to observing a much higher proportion of wingless daughters, produced by the stem mother, than what had previously been reported. Colony growth rates were significantly higher in a warmer environment than in the nearby plantation, suggesting that warmer temperatures in late spring and early summer may provide the suitable conditions required for M. abietinus colonies of greater density.

Such habitat alterations could be worsened by spruce budworm (SBW) outbreaks. Using 6201 vegetation plots from provincial inventories conducted after the last SBW outbreak (1968‚Äì1992) in boreal forests of Qu√©bec (Canada), we investigated the influence of SBW‚Äêcaused tree defoliation and mortality on understory vegetation layers relevant to woodland caribou and its main predators. We found a positive association between severe outbreaks and the cover of most groups of understory plant species, especially in stands that were dominated by balsam fir before the outbreak, where a high canopy openness particularly benefited relatively fast‚Äêgrowing deciduous plants. Such increases in early successional vegetation could provide high‚Äêquality forage for moose, which is likely to promote higher wolf densities and increase predation pressure on caribou. SBW outbreaks may thus negatively affect woodland caribou by increasing predation risk, the main factor limiting caribou populations in managed forests. For the near future, we recommend updating the criteria used to define critical caribou habitat to consider the potential impacts of spruce budworm defoliation.",,,,,2022,,10,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the spring of 1998 and 1999, we surveyed breeding waterfowl in 343 4-km2 plots distributed in the lowlands of the St. Lawrence Valley and Lac-Saint-Jean, Canada, and in agricultural areas of Abitibi-T√©miscamingue, Canada. American black duck densities were higher in dairy farm and forested landscapes (>39 indicated breeding pairs [IBPs]/100 km2) than in cropland landscapes (8 IBPs/100 km2). Mallard densities were similar across all landscape types (30‚Äì43 IBPs/100 km2). Habitat modeling using data derived from satellite imagery indicated that the presence of black ducks decreased with increasing areas of corn, ploughed fields, and deciduous forests, whereas it was favored in areas where topography was undulating with slopes of 10‚Äì15%. The same parameters had the opposite effect on mallard presence. The odds of black ducks being present were doubled where mallards were present, indicating that both species seem to be attracted to areas supporting adequate habitats, which contradicts the hypothesis of competition between these 2 species to explain for recent declines in the black duck population. Results of our habitat analyses support the hypothesis that habitat changes may be a primary factor leading to these declines. Dairy farm landscapes are of great importance for black ducks, and the conversion of this type of landscape toward a cropland landscape represents a threat to an important portion of the population of this species.",,,,,2006,,10,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goal was to investigate the interaction between two invasives, Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) and rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), which co-occur in several lakes in western Quebec, Canada, and to determine their overlap with littoral fish communities. Crayfish potentially aid milfoil dispersal by fragmentation or, alternatively, inhibit its proliferation through destruction and direct consumption. With a mesocosm experiment, we quantified milfoil fragment production versus biomass reduction by crayfish. More fragments were produced at medium to high crayfish densities, with a significant reduction of milfoil only at the highest densities, demonstrating the potential for both positive and negative interactions. Second, we determined the habitat preferences of each species by conducting a survey in the same lake.

We combined multiple approaches to study the influence of plant-enemy interactions on the upper elevational range limit of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) in southeastern Qu√©bec, Canada, where a previous study had demonstrated intense seed predation just beyond the range limit. Consistent with the hypothesis of release from natural enemies at the range limit, data from both natural patterns of regeneration and from seed and seedling transplant experiments showed higher seedling densities at the range edge than in the core of the species' distribution. A growth chamber experiment manipulating soil origin and temperature indicated that this so-called ""happy edge"" was not likely caused by temperature (i.e., the possibility that climate warming has made high elevation temperatures optimal for sugar maple) or by abiotic soil factors that vary along the elevational gradient. Finally, an insect-herbivore-exclusion experiment showed that insect herbivory was a major cause of seedling mortality in the core of sugar maple's distribution, whereas seedlings transplanted at or beyond the range edge experienced minimal herbivory (i.e., enemy release). Insect herbivory did not completely explain the high levels of seedling mortality in the core of the species' distribution, suggesting that seedlings at or beyond the range edge may also experience release from pathogens. In sum, while some effects of enemies are magnified beyond range edges (e.g., seed predation), others are dampened at and beyond the range edge (e.g., insect herbivory), such that understanding the net outcome of different biotic interactions within, at and beyond the edge of distribution is critical to predicting species' responses to global change.",,,,,2016,,10,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,No dataset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distribution of plant-parasitic nematodes in Quebec apple orchards. Plant Disease 64:582-583. In a survey of apple orchards in southeastern Quebec in 1978, 351 soil samples were collected from 71 orchards in nine counties. Species in eight genera of plant-parasitic nematodes were found. Species of Pratylenchus, Paratylenchus, and Xiphinema were detected most frequently. Pratylenchuspenetrans or Pratylenchus crenatus were found in all 71 orchards, at densities greater than 33/100 cm 3 of soil in 58% of infested samples. Xiphinema americanum was found in 88% of the orchards. Quebec is a major apple-growing province of Canada, producing about 110,000 metric tons annually on 8,000 ha. Most orchards are 20- to 30-yr-old trees on standard rootstocks such as Malus robusta 5 or seedlings (12). High density plantings on size-controlling rootstocks are gradually replacing the old orchards. Apple trees with union necrosis and decline have been found in Quebec (13,14). A virus closely related to tobacco ringspot virus was isolated from affected trees, and Xiphinema americanum, a vector of this virus, was always present in the rhizosphere of those trees.

Deer directly modify the composition and structure of vegetation communities, but they also indirectly affect other species of the ecosystem by modifying the structure of the vegetation. Here we review the results of a research program on overabundant white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the boreal forest of Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada) aimed at identifying deer densities compatible with forest regeneration. Various silvicultural systems and treatments failed to regenerate deer habitat at high deer densities, but planting size-adapted seedlings could be effective at moderate densities. Using a controlled deer density experiment, we found vegetation recovery at deer densities ‚â§ 15‚Äâdeer/km2. The same experiment revealed that other groups of organisms such as insects and birds responded favorably to a reduction of deer density. We also found that alternative successional trajectories may occur after a certain period of heavy browsing during early succession. We conclude that one of the most important remaining research gaps is the need to identify habitat-specific threshold densities at which deer impacts occur and then to design effective wildlife and forest management strategies to limit deer impacts and sustain ecosystem integrity.",,,,,2014,,10,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,No dataset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.)) ecosystems are widespread across the North American boreal forest, because of ecophysiological adaptations that allowed these communities to thrive in fire-prone areas. We investigated resilience of spruce-moss forests to weather-disturbance interaction after a 3-year period (2005 to 2007) of major fire activity caused by extreme fire weather in eastern Canada. Pre- and post-fire conifer densities and environmental parameters related to seed rain, post-fire seedbeds, microclimate, and post-fire weather were measured in 133 burned stands throughout the closed-crown forest of Quebec. Critically low black spruce (BS) regeneration was observed in almost all of the stands, leading to a decrease in stand density and a shift of species dominance from BS to jack pine (Pinus banksiana (Lamb.), JP). The studied sites were characterized by thick residual organic matter, resulting in a predominance of charred duff, a seedbed associated with low water retention and high variation in temperature. While high levels of JP seedling establishment were reported on this seedbed, it was unfavorable to BS germination and survival in the context of warm and dry weather that prevailed in post-fire summers. In these ecosystems, early vegetation establishment patterns are generally reliable predictors of future stand composition and the exclusion of BS will presumably be maintained through succession. During large fire years, high proportions of the landscape are subjected to the interaction of fire regime and weather that creates unsuitable conditions for BS regeneration. Hence, vegetation change is susceptible to happen at a broad scale. Therefore, the frequency of major fire years could have a decisive influence on the rate of vegetation response to climate change in this biome.",,,,,2013,,10,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,No dataset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether proliferating fungus species found in field soils are the species actually colonizing host plant roots, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were collected and identified from strawberry field soils and in root-initiated greenhouse trap cultures of sorghum and strawberry. The composition of AM fungus species from strawberry field soils did not perfectly match the fungus populations recovered from the root-initiated successive trap cultures. The study detected ten AM fungus species, half of which were found in trap cultures but not in the field soil samples. AMF species displayed different sporulation patterns with varying spore densities depending on the sample sites, the number of trap culture cycles, and the bait host plant. Glomus mosseaeand G. macrocarpumwere detected at two of the three sampling sites, across all of the trap cultures, regardless of the test plant involved.

It is also mandatory for the evaluation of production costs aimed at profitable farm operations, especially when land-based recirculation technology is the favoured rearing strategy. Spotted wolfish is a promising marine fish species and a candidate species in Quebec, Canada. Wolffishes displays strong domestication traits including a ‚Äúlow-stressed‚Äù behaviour. Reports on the physiological responses to stressors of spotted wolffish are scarce and stocking density recommendations for small size fish (range of 50-200g) are not yet available. A first trial evaluated the growth response of 50-100g juvenile wolffish to increasing densities (10, 20 and 40 Kg¬∑ m in duplicates) in order to identify the preferred range of density to evaluate more closely. A second trial was conducted in triplicates at fixed densities (20, 30 and 40 Kg¬∑ m) on 100-170g fish. Growth was only slightly impaired in the increasing densities trial where final densities reached >50 Kg¬∑ m. Acute stress challenge tests were conducted at the end of the growth trials. Cortisol, ionic composition, HSI, hematocrit, plasma protein and water content (liver and muscle), lysozyme activity were measured. Sedentary life-style of the spotted wolffish (sluggish swimmers and bottom occupancy) is a possible explanation for the observed weak primary, secondary and tertiary stress responses but most likely wolffishes can be considered highly resistant to stress and crowding conditions.",,,,,2010,,10,semantic_scholar,,,,non-field experiment,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a field experiment in a large recent boreal forest fire in central Quebec, we used 24 paired salvaged and non-salvaged stands to test the effect of salvage on the recruitment of two conifer species possessing an aerial seed bank (Pinus banksiana and Picea mariana). The seedbeds following salvage were, on average, more hospitable to germination, but, incongruously, engendered far lower regeneration densities. The poor recruitment on salvaged sites was due primarily to the loss of seeds following the immediate post-fire salvage, when cone-bearing branches were removed along with the trunks. By contrast, the density of the asexually-recruited Populus tremuloides was relatively unaffected.

However, in the last thirty years, irruptions of vole predators such as owls have been reported by ornithologists south of the North American boreal forest. While such southerly irruptions have been associated in Fennoscandia with periods of low abundance of small mammals within their usual distribution range, their possible cyclic nature and their relationships to fluctuations in vole densities at northern latitudes has not yet been demonstrated in North America. With information collected from existing data-bases, we examined the presence of cycles in small mammals and their main avian predators by using temporal autocorrelation analyses. Winter invasions of boreal owls (Aegolius funereus) were periodic, with a 4-yr cycle in Quebec. Populations of one species of small mammal, the red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi), fluctuated periodically in boreal forests of Quebec (north to 48¬∞N). Boreal owls show invasion cycles which correspond to years of low density of red-backed voles, the main food item for this owl species. In addition, winter observations of northern hawk owls (Surnia ulula) and great gray owls (Strix nebulosa) south of their usual range increased in years of low density of red-backed voles. Our results suggest that a 4-yr population cycle exists in the eastern boreal forest of North America for voles and owls, which is very similar to the one observed in Fennoscandia.",,,,,2004,,10,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,No dataset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the temporal trajectories of the herbaceous communities in Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. and Picea glauca (Moench) Voss stands on Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada) over 8 years following clear-cutting and deer management. The impact of deer exclusion or reduction to 7.5 and 15 deer¬∑km-2 was compared with benchmark in situ deer densities (27 and 56 deer¬∑km-2). Effects of deer management treatments on plant species and functional trait assemblages over time were assessed using principal response curves. Although complete deer exclusion seemed necessary to modify species composition from that occurring under intense browsing, a reduced density of 7.5 deer¬∑km-2 was sufficient to induce significant changes in functional trait assemblages of regenerating stands. For instance, reduced deer densities favored plants with brightly colored flowers and compound inflorescences pollinated by animals and producing large seeds and fleshy fruits dispersed by animals.

(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) by Trichogramma minutum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) was recorded in several host populations during the rising phase of an outbreak in the Gatineau Valley (Quebec, Canada) in 1999 and 2000. Some of the observed spruce budworm populations were subjected to experimental aerial applications of Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki during the course of the study. Untreated spruce budworm population densities at the onset of the study were directly related to stand composition (the proportion of non‚Äêhost basal area) but unrelated to plant species diversity. Much of the variation in budworm egg mass parasitism rates was accounted for (77.1% of total variance) by three variables: year, spruce budworm egg population density, and proportion of non‚Äêhost basal area in the stand. The exploitation of eggs within parasitised egg masses was related to year, B. thuringiensis treatment, egg mass size, and the proportion of egg masses parasitised in the host population (76.9% of variance). The yearly variation in parasitism rate was considerable, and was consistent with climatic conditions, namely heat accumulation and precipitation during the spruce budworm oviposition period.

Observations recorded by Neilson in the Green River area of New Brunswick (Canada) between 1948 and 1957 are discussed in the context of the present analysis. These results indicate that parasitism by T. minutum may be more predictable than previously believed and may be an important and consistent source of mortality in the several years preceding an outbreak of C. fumiferana, especially in mixed‚Äêwood stands and in warmer, drier portions of the spruce budworm's range.",,,,,2003,,10,semantic_scholar,,,,,yes,No dataset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research has shown that the establishment and development of oak seedlings prior to overstory removal, commonly referred to as advanced regeneration, is crucial for retaining oak species in the regenerated stand. The shelterwood reproduction method has been suggested as a means of developing the advance regeneration needed. In 1983, various shelterwood treatments were evaluated on the Fernow Experimental Forest in north-central West Virginia. Three overstory and two understory densities resulting in six treatment combinations were studied. Advanced red oak (Quercus rubra) regeneration was not abundant before treatment over most of the study area. Both natural regeneration and planted northern red oak and white ash (Fraxinus americana) seedlings were evaluated. Growth of planted seedlings was not significant after 5 years, though survival of red oak was improved significantly by both overstory and understory treatments. Natural regeneration of red oak was inadequate to recommend further overstory removal, and did not differ significantly by treatment combination. Overstory treatments stimulated abundant sweet birch (Betula lenta) regeneration, reducing the chances of establishing oak in the future. These results suggest that forest managers in the central Appalachian region may be unable to establish or develop advance regeneration of sufficient size and quantity when attempting to regenerate oaks on mesic sites with the shelterwood method as implemented here.",,,,,1995,,10,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
