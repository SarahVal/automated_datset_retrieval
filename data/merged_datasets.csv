Our objectives were to quantify the influence of local and landscape characteristics on the occurrence of the species in wetlands in southern Qu√©bec. We hypothesized that site occupancy depends on local characteristics and landscape characteristics contributing to site connectivity. We developed an environmental DNA (eDNA) method to detect the species and compared the detection probability of this method to traditional call surveys. We collected water samples at a total of 180 sites (90 in 2017, 110 in 2018), whereas we surveyed a subset of 63 sites using both eDNA and call surveys in 2018. Site occupancy varied across years, but was higher in sites where the species had been previously detected during the last 12 years by other studies. Site occupancy did not vary with other local and landscape characteristics, in part due to an apparent decrease in the number of sites occupied by the species since the last 12 years. Detection probability via eDNA (0.81; 95% CI: [0.31; 0.98]) did not differ from that of call surveys (0.62; 95% CI: [0.25; 0.89]). To identify the optimal sampling period for the boreal chorus frog, future studies should estimate the detection probability of eDNA during the breeding season and the larval development period of the species.</p>

https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%3A10.5061%2Fdryad.1771t,Data from: Resampling method for applying density-dependent habitat selection theory to wildlife surveys,"Isodar theory can be used to evaluate fitness consequences of density-dependent habitat selection by animals. A typical habitat isodar is a regression curve plotting competitor densities in two adjacent habitats when individual fitness is equal. Despite the increasing use of habitat isodars, their application remains largely limited to areas composed of pairs of adjacent habitats that are defined a priori. We developed a resampling method that uses data from wildlife surveys to build isodars in heterogeneous landscapes without having to predefine habitat types. The method consists in randomly placing blocks over the survey area and dividing those blocks in two adjacent sub-blocks of the same size. Animal abundance is then estimated within the two sub-blocks. This process is done 100 times. Different functional forms of isodars can be investigated by relating animal abundance and differences in habitat features between sub-blocks. We applied this method to abundance data of raccoons and striped skunks, two of the main hosts of rabies virus in North America. Habitat selection by raccoons and striped skunks depended on both conspecific abundance and the difference in landscape composition and structure between sub-blocks. When conspecific abundance was low, raccoons and striped skunks favored areas with relatively high proportions of forests and anthropogenic features, respectively. Under high conspecific abundance, however, both species preferred areas with rather large corn-forest edge densities and corn field proportions. Based on random sampling techniques, we provide a robust method that is applicable to a broad range of species, including medium- to large-sized mammals with high mobility. The method is sufficiently flexible to incorporate multiple environmental covariates that can reflect key requirements of the focal species. We thus illustrate how isodar theory can be used with wildlife surveys to assess density-dependent habitat selection over large geographic extents.",,,Wildlife survey_Procyon lotor_Mephitis mephitis_Striped skunk_Raccoon_capture,,7/5/2016,,0,dryad,,,,NA,yes,M,repository,.xlsx,sample coordinates,region names,site coordinates,"Racoon, striped skunks",2008,"source publication text, dataset",<1,no,1700,no,presence-absence,,,,Plos One,,,"Inside the downloable file, they provide sparial coordinates of the sampling - spatial range calculated with Qgis using them.

Knowing the relative contribution of vegetative propagation and sexual reproduction to the dispersal and establishment of exotic plants is crucial for devising efficient control strategies. This is particularly true for the common reed (Phragmites australis), one of the most invasive species in North America. 2. For the first time we combined in situ field observations and genetic evidence, based on two genotyping techniques, i.e., microsatellite markers (SSR) and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), to determine the propagation strategies of this invader at its northern distribution limit in North America, and especially in roadside ditches. 3. Field observations revealed that, in a region where the common reed is already abundant, both seeds and plant fragments contributed to the establishment of new populations. Newly established individuals originated mostly (84%) from seeds rather than fragments, but a larger proportion of individuals originating from fragments survived the second year compared to seedlings. 4. High genetic diversity among marsh and roadside common reed stands indicated the prime role of sexual reproduction for dispersal. The vast majority of genotypes were found in only one stand; such high genetic variability can only be explained by sexual reproduction. Half the surveyed stands comprised a single clone, suggesting that local expansion mainly occurred vegetatively. As the small proportion of SSR genotypes initially thought to be common between distant stands proved to be distinct (as revealed by GBS data), it is likely that all the stands examined were initially founded by genetically distinct individuals. 5. Synthesis. Our study suggests that long-distance dispersal by seeds is important for the common reed, in marshes and roadsides, while both seeds and plant fragments contribute to short-distance dispersal along roads, at least in regions where the species is already abundant. The success of this invader in North America seems to be attributable to a reproduction strategy combining the advantages of sexuality with those of vegetative propagation. Moreover, this study shows that the GBS approach strongly reduces uncertainties associated with the use of a limited number of markers. This approach is especially valuable for ecologists dealing with an ever increasing number of invaders, of which few have identified microsatellite markers.",,,genotyping-by-sequencing_Phragmites australis_road ecology_sexual reproduction_common reed_Invasion ecology_vegetative propagation_freshwater wetlands,,28/8/2016,,0,dryad,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.xlsx,site IDs,no,"Map, geological feature name",Phragmites australis,2009,source publication text ,<1,NA,416,source publication text,EBV genetic analysis,,,,Journal of Ecology,,,The spatial range is given in km because itís a transect-like sampling 
https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%3A10.5061%2Fdryad.sf1k4m8,Data from: Black spruce (Picea mariana) colonization of subarctic snowpatches in response to warmer climate,"1.   Snowpatches are disjunct arctic ecosystems scattered across the Subarctic, particularly on wind-protected lee slopes, where a thick snow cover accumulates during the winter. These snow-rich treeless ecosystems are affected by delayed snowmelt, causing shorter growing seasons. Snow-tolerant plants occupy the center of subarctic snowpatches   whereas black spruce trees grow at the margins. Snowpatches have shown sporadic expansion and shrinkage phases from tree establishment and mortality linked to climatic trends. Field surveys in the Subarctic of eastern Canada are showing an afforestation process occurring in snowpatches. The origin and nature of this afforestation were investigated based on the hypothesis that tree colonization and growth were closely associated with recent changes in climate.
2.   Snowpatches were categorized in three types based on border trees: forested, semi-forested and tundra-like. In eight randomly selected snowpatches of each type, snowpatch borders and areas covered by deciduous shrubs or trees were mapped and chionophilous plants and frost-associated soil disturbances were recorded. Radial (tree-ring  ) and vertical growth were measured on stems to evaluate the impact of climate and local factors on snowpatch black spruce populations.
3.   Two waves of spruce colonization occurred in all forested and semi-forested snowpatches in the 1960s and in the 1980s to present. Spruce establishment was more frequent and abundant in recent years, near the forest margins and on moss and barren seedbeds. Expanding shrub (dwarf birch) cover inhibited spruce seedling establishment. Tree establishment and growth were positively correlated with growing season temperature and negatively correlated with annual maximum snow depth. More recently established spruce seedlings exhibited faster vertical growth than those established in the 20thcentury.
4.   Synthesis: Due to warmer conditions and earlier snowmelt in eastern Canada, black spruce trees and dwarf birch shrubs are racing through subarctic snowpatches. This afforestation could change biodiversity in the Subarctic and affect watershed dynamics through a change in snowmelt pattern. Subarctic snowpatches are climate-sensitive ecosystems of the forest-tundra landscape, forming ideal biotopes for snow-tolerant, arctic-alpine species. Further tree encroachment in snowpatches in this century is potentially a threat to plant diversity, especially chionophilous species that have no corridors to migrate towards arctic ecosystems.",,,forest-tundra_plant-climate interactions_1950-2010_Holocene_treeline_tree-ring_Subarctic_Betula glandulosa_Picea mariana_snowpatch,,27/12/2018,,0,dryad,,,,NA,yes,M,repository,.xlsx,"site coordinates, IDs",no,Map,"Black spruce, other 16 plants",1960-2000,"source link abstract, dataset",40,no,63,no,"presence-absence, density",,,,Journal of Ecology,,,Data are characteristics of the sampling sites along with some measurements on certain seedlings
https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%3A10.5061%2Fdryad.r6s1c,Data from: Continental divide: predicting climate-mediated fragmentation and biodiversity loss in the boreal forest,"Climate change threatens natural landscapes through shifting distribution and abundance of species and attendant change in the structure and function of ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how climate-mediated variation in species' environmental niche space may lead to large-scale fragmentation of species distributions, altered meta-population dynamics and gene flow, and disrupted ecosystem integrity. Such change may be especially relevant when species distributions are restricted either spatially or to a narrow environmental niche, or when environments are rapidly changing. Here, we use range-wide environmental niche models to posit that climate-mediated range fragmentation aggravates the direct effects of climate change on species in the boreal forest of North America. We show that climate change will directly alter environmental niche suitability for boreal-obligate species of trees, birds and mammals (n=12), with most species ranges becoming smaller and shifting northward through time. Importantly, species distributions will become increasingly fragmented, as characterized by smaller mean size and greater isolation of environmentally-suitable landscape patches. This loss is especially pronounced along the Ontario-Qu√©bec border, where the boreal forest is narrowest and roughly 78% of suitable niche space could disappear by 2080. Despite the diversity of taxa surveyed, patterns of range fragmentation are remarkably consistent, with our models predicting that spruce grouse (Dendragapus canadensis), boreal chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus), moose (Alces americanus) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) could have entirely disjunct east-west population segments in North America. These findings reveal potentially dire consequences of climate change on population continuity and species diversity in the boreal forest, highlighting the need to better understand: 1) extent and primary drivers of anticipated climate-mediated range loss and fragmentation; 2) diversity of species to be affected by such change; 3) potential for rapid adaptation in the most strongly-affected areas; and 4) potential for invasion by replacement species.",,,Holocene,,25/4/2018,,0,dryad,,,,NA,yes,H,repository,GeoTIFF,no,no,no,"Dendragapus canadensis, Poecile hudsonicus, Alces americanus, Rangifer tarandus, other 8 mammals, 4 tree species, 3 bird species",1950-2000,source publication text,50,NA,24706834,source link abstract,distribution,,,,Plos One,,,They retrieve the data from GBIF and other multiple surveys to build current and future distributions. 8 of the 12 species are not mentioned in the main link page but in the datasets

As such, species of the Ericaceae family have a major effect on the regeneration of tree species in boreal ecosystems. It is thus imperative to understand the ecological gradients controlling their distribution and abundance, so that their impacts can be taken into account in sustainable forest management. Using innovative analytical techniques from landscape ecology, we aimed to position, along ecological gradients, four Ericaceae found in the boreal forest of Quebec (Canada) (Rhododendron groenlandicum, Kalmia angustifolia, Chamaedaphne calyculata, and Vaccinium spp), to regionalize these species into landscape units relevant to forest management, and to estimate the relative importance of several ecological drivers (climate, disturbances, stand attributes, and physical environment) that control the species distribution and abundance. We conducted our study in boreal Quebec, over a study area covering 535,355 km2. We used data from 15,339 ecological survey plots and forest maps to characterize 1422 ecological districts covering the study region. We evaluated the relative proportion of each ericaceous species and explanatory variables at the district level. Vegetation and explanatory variables matrices were used to conduct redundancy, cluster, and variation partitioning analyses. We observed that ericaceous species are mainly distributed in the western part of the study area and each species has a distinct latitudinal and longitudinal gradient distribution. On the basis of these gradients, we delimited 10 homogeneous landscape units distinct in terms of ericaceous species abundance and environmental drivers. The distribution of the ericaceous species along ecological gradients is closely related to the overlaps between the four sets of explanatory variables considered. We conclude that the studied Ericaceae occupy specific positions along ecological gradients and possess a specific abundance and distribution controlled by the integration of multiple explanatory variables.",,,Kalmia angustifolia_Anthropocene_redundancy analysis_Rhododendron groenlandicum_landscape ecology_Vaccinium angustifolium_Chamaedaphne calyculata_Vaccinium myrtilloides_ecological drivers,,11/3/2016,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,H,repository,.csv,no,no,Map,"Rhododendron groenlandicum, Kalmia angustifolia, Chamaedaphne calyculata, Vaccinium spp",1980-2000,source publication text,20,NA,535355,"source link abstract, source publication text",abundance,,,,Ecology and Evolution,,,

However, Atlantic salmon stocked juveniles show higher mortality rates than wild ones when introduced into nature. Hatchery environment, which greatly differs from the natural environment, is  identified as the main driver of the phenotypic mismatch between captive and wild parrs. The latter is also suspected to impact the gut microbiota composition, which can be associated with essential metabolic functions for their host. We hypothesized that hatchery raised parrs potentially recruit gut microbial communities that are different from those  recruited in the wild. This study evaluated the impacts of artificial rearing on gut microbiota composition in 0+ parrs meant for stocking in two distinct Canadian rivers: Rimouski and Malbaie (Quebec, Canada). Striking differences between hatchery and wild born parrs‚Äô gut microbiota suggest that microbiota could be another factor that could impact their survival in the targeted river, since the microbiome is narrowly related to host physiology. For instance, major commensals belonging to Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridiacea from wild parrs‚Äô gut microbiota were substituted in captive parrs by lactic acid bacteria from the Lactobacillaceae family. Overall, captive parrs host a generalist bacterial community whereas wild parrs‚Äô microbiota is much more specialized. This is the very first study demonstrating extensive impact of captive rearing on intestinal microbiota composition in Atlantic salmon intended for wild population stocking. Our results strongly suggest the need to implement microbial ecology concepts into conservation management of endangered salmon stocks supplemented with hatchery reared parrs.",,,Captive Populations_16S SSU rRNA gene_Endangered species management_Salmo salar_2013_metabarcoding sequencing_Aquaculture_Stocking,,1/6/2018,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,X,repository,,NA,NA,NA,Gut microbiota from atlantic salmon,,,,,,,genetic analysis,,,,Evolutionary Applications,,,
https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%3A10.5061%2Fdryad.qt30h,Data from: The phylogenetics of succession can guide restoration: an example from abandoned mine sites in the subarctic,"1. Phylogenetic tools have increasingly been used in community ecology to describe evolutionary relationships among co-occurring species. In studies of succession, such tools may allow us to identify evolutionary lineages most suited for particular stages of succession and habitat rehabilitation. However, to date these two applications have been largely separate. Here, we suggest that information on phylogenetic community structure might help inform community restoration strategies following major disturbance. 2. Our study examined phylogenetic patterns of succession based on a chronosequence of three abandoned subarctic mine spoil heaps (waste piles) dating from the early 1970s, mid-1970s and early 1980s. The vegetation at each mine site was compared to the surrounding vegetation and community structure on mines was explored assuming species pools at nested spatial scales. 3. We found that the adjacent vegetation was more phylogenetically clustered than the vegetation on the mines, with mines demonstrating weaker phylogenetic community structure. Using simulation models, we showed that phylogenetic dissimilarity between mine sites did not depart from null expectations. However, we found evidence for species sorting along abiotic gradients (slope and aspect) on the mine sites that had been abandoned for the longest. 4. Synthesis and applications. Understanding the trajectory of succession is critical for restoration efforts. Our results suggest that early colonizers represent a phylogenetically random subset of species from the local species pool. Over time there appears to be selection for particular lineages that come to be filtered across space and environment. The species most appropriate for mine site restoration might, therefore, depend on the successional stage of the community and the local species composition. For example, in later succession, it could be more beneficial to facilitate establishment of more distant relatives. Our findings can improve management practices by providing relatedness information for known successful colonizers and by informing seeding decisions with knowledge of the surrounding and regional species pools. The application of phylogenetics to restoration ecology and succession is relatively new, but it has the potential to provide novel insight into the dynamics of changing community structures during succession.",,,species pool_null models_phylogenetic beta-diversity_net-relatedness index,,13/8/2015,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.csv,administrative unit,Administrative unit,site coordinates,communities (42 spp),no,NA,no,no,"0,5",no,abundance (percent cover),,,,Journal of Applied Ecology,,,sampling location in the main publication

Prezygotic and postzygotic barriers impacting a native poplar hybrid stand.,"Hybridization and introgression are pervasive evolutionary phenomena that provide insight to the selective forces that maintain species boundaries, permit gene flow and control the direction of evolutionary change. Poplar trees (Populus L.) are well known for their ability to form viable hybrids and maintain their distinct species boundaries despite this interspecific gene flow. We sought to quantify the hybridization dynamics and postzygotic fitness within a hybrid stand of balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.), eastern cottonwood (P. deltoides Marsh.) and their natural hybrids to gain insight to the barriers maintaining this stable hybrid zone. We observed asymmetrical hybrid formation with P. deltoides acting as the seed parent, but with subsequent introgression biased towards P. balsamifera. Native hybrids expressed fitness traits intermediate to the parental species and were not universally unfit. That said, native hybrid seedlings were absent from the seedling population, which may indicate additional selective pressures controlling their recruitment. It is imperative that we understand the selective forces maintaining this native hybrid zone in order to quantify the impact of exotic poplar hybrids on this native system.",,,Populus deltoides_SNPs_Melampsora sp._reproductive fitness_Holocene_postzygotic fitness_Populus balsamifera,,17/3/2015,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,".csv, .xlsx, .txt",no,no,Administrative unit,"Populus balsamifera, Populus deltoides, hybrids",2009-2011,source publication text,2,NA,1.36,source publication text,"EBV genetic analysis, other",,,,Ecology and Evolution,,,
https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%3A10.5061%2Fdryad.7tn01,Data from: Trait-matching and phylogeny as predictors of predator-prey interactions involving ground beetles,"With global change modifying species assemblages, our success in predicting ecosystem level consequences of these new communities will depend, in part, on our ability to understand biotic interactions. Current food web theory considers interactions between numerous species simultaneously, but descriptive models are unable to predict interactions between newly co-occurring species. Incorporating proxies such as functional traits and phylogeny into models could help infer predator/ prey interactions.
Here we used trait-matching between predator feeding traits and prey vulnerability traits, along with phylogeny (used as a proxy for chemical defence and other traits difficult to document), to infer predatory interactions using ground beetles as model organisms.
A feeding experiment was conducted involving 20 ground beetle and 115 prey species to determine which pair of species did or did not interact. Eight predator and four prey functional traits were measured directly on specimens. Then, using a modeling approach based on the matching-centrality formalism, we evaluated 511 predictive ecological models that tested different combinations of all predator and prey functional traits, and phylogenetic information.
The most parsimonious model accurately predicted 81 % of the observed realized and unrealized interactions, using phylogenetic information and the trait-matches predator biting force/ prey cuticular toughness and predator/ prey body size ratio. The best trait-based models predicted correctly >80 % which species interact (realized interactions), but predict <58 % of which species did not interact (unrealized interactions). Adding a phylogenetic term representing the evolutionary distance within each trophic level increased the ability to predict which species did not interact to >75 %.
The matching of predator biting force and prey cuticular toughness demonstrated a better predictive power than the commonly used predator/ prey body size ratio. Our novel model combining both functional traits and phylogeny extends beyond existing descriptive approaches and could represent a valuable tool to predict consumer/ resource interactions of newly introduced species and to resolve cryptic food webs.",,,networks_Matching-centrality formalism_Diplopoda_Isopoda_Carabidae_Pseudoscorpiones_Araneae_trophic interactions,,19/6/2018,,3,dryad,,,,not in the field,no,X,repository,,NA,NA,NA,20 ground beetle,,,,,,,other,,,,Functional Ecology,,,Experiment.

Impact of exotic sex on native poplars in an urban jungle.,"Trees bearing novel or exotic gene components are poised to contribute to the bioeconomy for a variety of purposes such as bioenergy production, phytoremediation, and carbon sequestration within the forestry sector, but sustainable release of trees with novel traits in large-scale plantations requires the quantification of risks posed to native tree populations. Over the last century, exotic hybrid poplars produced through artificial crosses were planted throughout eastern Canada as ornamentals or windbreaks and these exotics provide a proxy by which to examine the fitness of exotic poplar traits within the natural environment to assess risk of exotic gene escape, establishment, and spread into native gene pools. We assessed postzygotic fitness traits of native and exotic poplars within a naturally regenerated stand in eastern Canada (Quebec City, QC). Pure natives (P. balsamifera and P. deltoides spp. deltoides), native hybrids (P. deltoides √ó P. balsamifera), and exotic hybrids (trees bearing Populus nigra and P. maximowiczii genetic components) were screened for reproductive biomass, yield, seed germination, and fungal disease susceptibility. Exotic hybrids expressed fitness traits intermediate to pure species and were not significantly different from native hybrids. They formed fully viable seed and backcrossed predominantly with P. balsamifera. These data show that exotic hybrids were not unfit and were capable of establishing and competing within the native stand.

Researchers have recently investigated Œ≤-defensin genes in the wild, because their variability suggests that they may play an important role in innate host defense. This study investigated the variation occurring at 6 innate immune genes of the Œ≤-defensin family in a declining population of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in southern Qu√©bec, Canada (N = 160). We found that all 6 genes showed synonymous and nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the exon coding for the mature peptide. These results indicated that this group of genes was diverse in tree swallows. Our results suggested a potential interaction of this group of genes with fluctuating pathogen diversity, however, we found no sign of positive or negative selection. We assessed whether or not the distribution of genetic diversity of Œ≤-defensin genes in our study population differed between 2 regions that strongly differ in their level of agricultural intensification. Adults are highly philopatric to their breeding sites and their immunological responses differ between these 2 regions. However, we found little evidence that the level and distribution of genetic variability differed between these heterogeneous environmental conditions.

Little is known about the incidence of physiological convergence in natural populations, so here we test whether energy metabolism in ‚Äòdwarf‚Äô and ‚Äònormal‚Äô Lake Whitefish evolves by similar mechanisms. Prior genomic and transcriptomic studies have found that divergence in energy metabolism is key to local adaptation in whitefish species pairs, but that distinct genetic and transcriptomic changes often underlie phenotypic evolution among lakes. Here, we predicted that traits at higher levels of biological organization, including the activities of energy metabolism enzymes (the product of enzyme concentration and turnover rate) and the relative proportions of metabolically active tissues (heart, liver, skeletal muscle), would show greater convergence than genetic and transcriptomic variation. We compared four whitefish species pairs and found convergence in organ size whereby all dwarf whitefish populations have a higher proportion of red skeletal muscle, three have relatively larger livers and two have relatively larger ventricles than normal fish. On the other hand, hepatic and muscle enzyme activities showed little convergence and were largely dependent on lake of origin. Only the most genetically divergent species pair (Cliff Lake) displayed white muscle enzyme activities matching results from laboratory-reared normal and dwarf whitefish. Overall, these data show convergence in the evolution of organ size, but not in the activities of candidate enzymes of energy metabolism, which may have evolved mainly as a consequence of demographic or ecological differences among lakes.",,,Liver_aerobic energy metabolism_Coregonus clupeaformis_glycolysis_red muscle_white muscle_heart,,20/9/2016,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.csv ,no,no,site coordinates,Coregonus clupeaformis,2013,source publication text,>1,no,no,NA,"presence-only, other",,,,Molecular Ecology,,,sampling location in the main publication

Because they also may affect mate choice, they are candidates for having great importance in ecological speciation. Here, we use next-generation sequencing to test the general hypothesis of parallelism in patterns of MHCIIŒ≤ diversity and bacterial infections among five dwarf and normal whitefish sympatric pairs. A second objective was to assess the functional relationships between specific MHCIIŒ≤ alleles and pathogens in natural conditions. Each individual had between one and four alleles, indicating two paralogous loci. In Cliff Lake, the dwarf ecotype was monomorphic for the most common allele. In Webster Lake, the skew in the allelic distribution was towards the same allele but in the normal ecotype, underscoring the nonparallel divergence among lakes. Our signal of balancing selection matched putative peptide binding region residues in some cases, but not in others, supporting other recent findings of substantial functional differences in fish MHCIIŒ≤ compared with mammals. Individuals with fewer alleles were less likely to be infected; thus, we found no evidence for the heterozygote advantage hypothesis. MHCIIŒ≤ alleles and pathogenic bacteria formed distinct clusters in multivariate analyses, and clusters of certain alleles were associated with clusters of pathogens, or sometimes the absence of pathogens, indicating functional relationships at the individual level.

Despite the importance of precision and accuracy of genetic variance estimates and their potential sensitivity to various ecological and population specific factors, their reliability is rarely tested explicitly. Here, we used simulations and empirical data collected from an 11-year study on tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), a species showing a high rate of extra-pair paternity and a low recruitment rate, to assess the importance of identity errors, structure and size of the pedigree on quantitative genetic estimates in our dataset. Our simulations revealed an important lack of precision in heritability and genetic-correlation estimates for most traits, a low power to detect significant effects and important identifiability problems. We also observed a large bias in heritability estimates when using the social pedigree instead of the genetic one (deflated heritabilities) or when not accounting for an important cause of resemblance among individuals (for example, permanent environment or brood effect) in model parameterizations for some traits (inflated heritabilities). We discuss the causes underlying the low reliability observed here and why they are also likely to occur in other study systems. Altogether, our results re-emphasize the difficulties of generalizing quantitative genetic estimates reliably from one study system to another and the importance of reporting simulation analyses to evaluate these important issues.",,,animal models_Pedigree simulation_Extra-pair paternities_Tachycineta bicolor_statistical power_Pedigree errors,,26/8/2016,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,M,repository,.txt,no,no,no,Tachycineta bicolor,2004-2016,"source publication text, dataset",12,source link abstract,10200,source publication text,"EBV genetic analysis, other",,,,Heredity,,,sampling location in the main publication

A diverse array of wild bee species may provide more effective pollination than the widely employed European honey bee (Apis mellifera L.). High species richness within crop pollinator assemblages has been linked to enhanced fruit and seed yields, but species richness is often confounded with abundance in studies of pollinator communities. 2. We investigated the effects of bee diversity and species identity on pollen deposition and crop yield in the strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) variety Jewel through a field experiment that independently manipulated the species richness and abundance of flower visitors. We used a new pollen deposition measurement technique to determine the pollen contribution of individual bees in an assemblage of flower visits. We compared the performance of wild bee species and managed honey bees, as pollinators of strawberry. We also calculated the influence of species richness, visit frequency, and visitor identity on fruit mass, using the fruit that developed from each sampled flower. 3. Species richness of flower visitors did not influence floral pollen loads or strawberry mass. Honey bees and wild bees deposited the same amount of pollen per visited flower. However, strawberries that developed from flowers visited by wild bees were heavier than flowers visited by honey bees. In addition, flowers visited by a combination of wild and honey bees produced strawberries that weighed less than flowers receiving purely wild bee visits. 4. Synthesis and applications: Our findings show that honey bee pollination results in lower yields than wild bee pollination in a strawberry crop. Consequently, if managed honey bees in strawberry fields displace wild pollinators, growers may obtain suboptimal yields. Management efforts aimed at the maintenance or enhancement of wild pollinator populations may therefore be a cost-effective way to increase both crop yield and biodiversity on strawberry farms.</p>

If a species is locally adapted at its range margin it could be beneficial for range expansion as it ensures that the genotypes colonizing new areas are the fittest because environmental conditions are more similar to the current ones. In trees, local adaptation can slow range expansion when climate change happens much faster than their ability to migrate. We investigate experimentally a series of factors thought to constrain the seedling phase at the leading edge of the distribution of a dominant tree species, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall.). We established a seed transplant experiment using six provenances, representing the latitudinal species range, and transplanted them to 12 sites within, at, and beyond the current northern species range margin. Northern provenances currently provide the best opportunity for establishment beyond the actual range, where climatic conditions are more similar than those of the warmer central or southern portions of the species range. While establishment was highest within the species range, survival rates were comparable to those at the range margin and beyond, regardless of provenance. We also find that the local climate is the most influential factor for early seedling establishment and survival; however, a lack of suitable microsites also significantly constrained recruitment. Our study highlights the complex interaction between provenance, climate, and microsite conditions that are required to ensure successful seedling recruitment. While sugar maple is currently displaying evidence for local adaptation to facilitate range shifts, it could risk maladaptation in the future if the local climate warms beyond threshold required to ensure seed germination and a lack of favourable microsite conditions beyond the range.",,,provenance_Acer saccharum_temperate-boreal forest transition_range shift_2013-2015,,10/8/2019,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.csv,no,no,site coordinates,Acer saccharum ,2013,source publication text,>1,no,187000,no,other,,,,Global Ecology and Biogeography,,,

Short-range connectivity within habitat networks provides organisms access to spatially distributed resources, reduces local extinctions and increases recolonization of habitat fragments. Long-range connectivity across habitat networks facilitates annual migrations and climate-driven range shifts.
We present a method for identifying a multipurpose network of forest patches that promotes both short- and long-range connectivity. Our method uses both graph-theoretic analyses that quantify network connectedness and circuit-based analyses that quantify network traversability as the basis for identifying spatial conservation priorities on the landscape.  We illustrate our approach in the agroecosystem, bordered by the Laurentian and Appalachian mountain ranges, that surrounds the metropolis of Montreal, Canada. We established forest conservation priorities for the ovenbird, a Neotropical migrant, sensitive to habitat fragmentation that breeds in our study area. All connectivity analyses were based on the same empirically informed resistance surface for ovenbird, but habitat pixels that facilitated short- and long-range connectivity requirements had low spatial correlation. The trade-off between connectivity requirements in the final ranking of conservation priorities showed a pattern of diminishing returns such that beyond a threshold, additional conservation of long-range connectivity had decreased effectiveness on the conservation of short-range connectivity. Highest conservation priority was assigned to a series of stepping stone forest patches across the study area that promote traversability between the bordering mountain ranges and to a collection of small forest fragments scattered throughout the study area that provide connectivity within the agroecosystem.  Landscape connectivity is important for the ecology and genetics of populations threatened by climate change and habitat fragmentation. Our method has been illustrated as a means to conserve two critical dimensions of connectivity for a single species, but it is designed to incorporate a variety of connectivity requirements for many species. Our approach can be tailored to local, regional and continental conservation initiatives to protect essential species movements that will allow biodiversity to persist in a changing climate.",,,network theory_connectivity conservation_Circuitscape_Seiurus aurocapilla,,31/8/2015,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.tif,no,no,"Map, site coordinates",ovenbird,no,NA,no,NA,27500,source publication text,other,,,,Methods in Ecology and Evolution,,,Study area (species habitat) in the main publication

With reduced temporal periods during which ice conditions are favourable for locomotion, freshwater bodies could become impediments to the inter-patch movements, dispersion, or migration of terrestrial animals that use ice-covered lakes and rivers to move across their range. Studying the fine-scale responses of individuals to broad-scale changes in ice availability and phenology would help to understand how animals react to ongoing climate change, and contribute to the conservation and management of endangered species living in northern environments.

Here, we examined spatial and temporal variation of genetic structure among 13 populations of the Lyme disease vector, the black-legged tick, in southern Quebec, where this tick species is currently expanding and Lyme disease is emerging. Our objective was to identify the primary mode of tick movement into Canada based on observed spatial and temporal genetic patterns. Upon genotyping ten microsatellite loci from 613 tick specimens, we found multiple genetic signatures of frequent long-distance dispersal events, supporting the hypothesis that migratory birds are the primary carriers of black-legged ticks into southern Quebec. When we compared results from analyses of pairwise differences among ticks collected from eight different sites at different years between 2011 and 2014, we found that genetic variation observed among tick individuals appeared to be better explained by collection year than sampling locality. This suggests that while cohorts of black-legged ticks can rapidly invade large areas across southern Quebec, they also appear to be undergoing frequent turnover. Finally, the amount of genetic variation in tick populations across our study area appeared to be related to their degree of establishment, with established populations displaying a lower amount of temporal genetic variation than adventitious ones. Given that Lyme disease infection risk in a region can be influenced by the relative presence of established and/or adventitious tick populations, our results are useful for understanding both the seasonality and spatial variation of Lyme disease.",,,genetic turnover_Population structure and phylogeography_zoonotic disease emergence_Ixodes scapularis,,3/10/2016,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,M,repository,.xlsx,sample coordinates,no,"Map, geological feature name",black-legged tick,2011-2014,"source link abstract, dataset, source publication text",3,NA,2080,source publication text,"presence only, EBV genetic analysis",,,,Journal of Heredity,,,

The basidiomycetous fungus Onnia tomentosa is one of the most widespread root rot pathogens in North America. Although the disease is more severe on spruce and pine trees, this pathogen can infect several coniferous species. In order to study the population structure of O. tomentosa, we harvested 180 basidiocarps in a 45-year-old white spruce plantation in western Quebec in autumn 1997, and extracted DNA directly from individual basidiocarps. Using a combination of spatial coordinates and molecular data based on the analysis of two mitochondrial and three nuclear loci, we measured the average genet size and molecular diversity and assessed the relative contribution of basidiospores and vegetative growth to the stand colonization. Most of the sampled basidiocarps that clustered spatially belonged to the same genet. A total of thirty-seven discrete multilocus genets of an average size of 3.42 m were obtained. The genet size distribution was skewed toward smaller genets (< 3 m) that displayed higher diversity than the larger genets (> 3 m). The nuclear loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the larger genets, but not in the smaller genets, which displayed a deficiency of heterozygotes. This suggests a Wahlund effect, whereby different colonization events resulted in expected heterozygosity higher than observed heterozygosity. Using an estimate of the growth rate of the fungus, only a few of the largest genets were approximately the age of the plantation. These observations are consistent with the colonization by basidiospores subsequent to site preparation and tree planting followed by secondary colonization events and vegetative spread.",,,Buller phenomenon_Onnia tomentosa_Wahlund effect_Host Parasite Interactions_Disease Biology_root rot,,11/1/2011,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,X,repository,,,,,Onnia tomentosa,1997,,,,,,other,,,,Molecular Ecology,,,

Agricultural intensification in the breeding range is often regarded as one of the main drivers of these declines. Here, we tested the hypothesis that body mass in breeding individuals should reflect habitat quality in an aerial insectivore, the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), along a gradient of agricultural intensity. Our dataset was collected over 7 years (2005‚Äì2011) and included 2918 swallow captures and 1483 broods. Analyses revealed a substantial decline of the population over the course of the study (‚àí19% occupancy rate), mirrored by decreasing body mass. This trend was especially severe in females, representing a total loss of 8% of their mass. Reproductive success was negatively influenced by intensive agriculture, but did not decrease over time. Interestingly, variation in body mass was independent of breeding habitat quality, leading us to suggest that this decline in body mass may result from carry-over effects from non-breeding areas and affect population dynamics through reduced survival. This work contributes to the growing body of evidence suggesting that declines in migratory aerial insectivores are driven by multiple, complex factors requiring better knowledge of year-round habitat use.",,,agricultural intensification_Tree swallow_Aerial insectivores_Breeding success_Tachycineta bicolor,,25/4/2014,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,M,repository,.xlsx,site coordinates,no,no,Tachycineta bicolor,2005-2011,source link abstract,7,source link abstract,10200,source publication text,EBV genetic analysis,,,,Proceedings of the Royal Society B,,,No spatial coordinates or locations provided

The main goal of this study was to investigate the extent of parallelism in the genomic and phenotypic divergence between piscivorous and planktivorous lake trout ecotypes from Laurentian Shield lakes, Canada. This was achieved by documenting the extent of morphological differentiation using geometric morphometrics and linear measurements as well as the pattern of genomic divergence by means of RADseq genotyping (3925 filtered SNPs) in 12 lakes. Our results indicate that the two ecotypes evolved distinct body shape and several linear measurements in parallel. Neutral genetic differentiation was pronounced between all isolated populations (Mean FST = 0.433), indicating no or very limited migration and pronounced genetic drift. Significant genetic differentiation also suggested partial reproductive isolation between ecotypes in the two lakes where they are found in sympatry. Combining different outlier detection methods, we identified 48 SNPs putatively under divergent selection between ecotypes, among which 10 could be annotated and related to functions such as developmental processes and ionic regulation. Finally, our results indicate that parallel morphological divergence is accompanied by both parallel and nonparallel genomic divergence, which is associated with the use of different trophic niches between ecotypes.

Empirical investigation using RADseq in a northern lacustrine fish,"Understanding genomic signatures of divergent selection underlying long-term adaptation in populations located in heterogeneous environments is a key goal in evolutionary biology. In this study, we investigated neutral, adaptive and deleterious genetic variation using 7,192 SNPs in 31 Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations (n = 673) from Qu√©bec, Canada. Average genetic diversity was low, weakly shared among lakes, and positively correlated to lake size, indicating a major role for genetic drift subsequent to lake isolation. Putatively deleterious mutations were on average at lower frequencies than the other SNPs, and their abundance relative to the entire polymorphism in each population was positively correlated to inbreeding, suggesting that the effectiveness of purifying selection was negatively correlated to inbreeding, as predicted from theory. Despite evidence for pronounced genetic drift and inbreeding, several outlier loci were associated with temperature and found in or close to genes with biologically relevant functions notably related to heat-stress and immune responses. Outcomes of gene-temperature associations were influenced by the inclusion of the most inbred populations, in which allele frequencies deviated the most from model predictions. This result illustrates challenge in identifying gene-environment associations in cases of high genetic drift and restricted gene flow and suggests limited adaptation in populations experiencing higher inbreeding.

Using a medium-density SNP array, we documented genomic diversity and divergence at 2336 genetically mapped loci among three pairs of North American anadromous and freshwater Atlantic salmon populations. Our results show that across the genome, freshwater populations have lower diversity and a smaller proportion of private polymorphism relative to anadromous populations. Moreover, differentiation was more pronounced among freshwater than among anadromous populations at multiple spatial scales, suggesting a large effect of genetic drift in these isolated freshwater populations. Using nonhierarchical and hierarchical genome scans, we identified hundreds of markers spread across the genome that are potentially under divergent selection between anadromous and freshwater populations, but few outlier loci were repeatedly found in all three freshwater‚Äìanadromous comparisons. Similarly, a sliding window analysis revealed numerous regions of high divergence that were nonparallel among the three comparisons. These last results show little evidence for the parallel evolution of alleles selected for in freshwater populations, but suggest nonparallel adaptive divergence at many loci of small effects distributed through the genome. Overall, this study emphasizes the important role of genetic drift in driving genome-wide reduction in diversity and divergence in freshwater Atlantic salmon populations and suggests a complex multigenic basis of adaptation to resident and anadromous strategies with little parallelism.",,,Salmo salar,,20/9/2017,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,M,repository,.txt,no,no,"Map, geological feature name",Atlantic salmon,no,NA,no,no,10000,no,EBV genetic analysis,,,,Molecular Ecology,,,

Introduced populations also demonstrated higher connectivity and gene flow than those in their native range. Evidence for candidate loci under divergent selection was observed, but was limited to specific introduced populations and was not widely evident.

American shad is a wide ranging anadromous clupeid fish that exhibits variation in demographic histories and reproductive strategies (both semelparity and iteroparity) and provides a unique perspective on the evolutionary processes that govern the genetic architecture of anadromous fishes. Using 13 microsatellite loci, we examined the magnitude and spatial distribution of genetic variation among 33 populations across the species' range to (i) determine whether signals of historical demography persist among contemporary populations and (ii) assess the effect of different reproductive strategies on population structure. Patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation among populations varied widely and reflect the differential influences of historical demography, microevolutionary processes and anthropogenic factors across the species' range. Sequential reductions of diversity with latitude among formerly glaciated rivers are consistent with stepwise postglacial colonization and successive population founder events. Weak differentiation among U.S. iteroparous populations may be a consequence of human-mediated gene flow, while weak differentiation among semelparous populations probably reflects natural gene flow. Evidence for an effect of reproductive strategy on population structure suggests an important role for environmental variation and suggests that the factors that are responsible for shaping American shad life history patterns may also influence population genetic structure.",,,reproductive strategies_clinal variation_American shad_Alosa sapidissima,,13/12/2012,,3,dryad,,,,location,no,X,,,,,,Alosa sapidissima,,,,,,,,,,,Molecular Ecology,,,USA

Eastern Wolves, a species at risk in Canada, are centralized in Algonquin Provincial Park and their ability to disperse and establish themselves elsewhere is limited by human-caused mortality associated with hunting, trapping, and vehicle collisions. Here, we refine our understanding of Eastern Wolf distribution and provide the first estimates of their effective population size. Location: Southern Ontario and Gatineau Quebec. Methods: We used noninvasive samples, as well as blood samples archived from other research projects, collected between 2010 ‚Äì 2014 to generate autosomal microsatellite genotypes at 12 loci for 98 Canis individuals. We utilized Bayesian and multivariate clustering analyses to identify Eastern Wolves in regions that were previously unsampled. Both linkage disequilibrium and temporal approaches were used to estimate effective population size of Eastern Wolves.  Results: Assignment tests identified 34 individuals as Eastern Wolves, primarily in or near two provincial parks: Killarney and Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands. Eastern Coyotes were identified in Bon Echo Provincial Park, Frontenac Provincial Park, and Gatineau Park, whereas many of the samples were admixed among the different Canis types. Effective population size (Ne) estimates ranged from 24.3 ‚Äì 122.1 with a harmonic mean of 45.6.  Main Conclusions: The identification of Eastern Wolves in the regions of Killarney and Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Parks extends the range of Eastern Wolves north of the French River and southward into previously unidentified regions.

While species utilization of the landscape is usually viewed as constant within a year, the spatial distribution of individuals is likely to vary in time in relation to particular seasonal needs. Understanding temporal variation in landscape use and genetic connectivity has direct conservation implications. Here, we modelled the daily use of the landscape by caribou in Quebec and Labrador, Canada and tested its ability to explain the genetic relatedness among individuals. We assessed habitat selection using locations of collared individuals in migratory herds and static occurrences from sedentary groups. Connectivity models based on habitat use outperformed a baseline isolation-by-distance model in explaining genetic relatedness, suggesting that variations in landscape features such as snow, vegetation productivity and land use modulate connectivity among populations. Connectivity surfaces derived from habitat use were the best predictors of genetic relatedness. The relationship between connectivity surface and genetic relatedness varied in time and peaked during the rutting period. Landscape permeability in the period of mate searching is especially important to allow gene flow among populations.

Quantifying how plant diversity affects decomposition is thus crucial for predicting the effect of the global decline in plant diversity on ecosystem functioning. Plant diversity could affect the decomposition process both directly through the diversity of the litter, and/or indirectly through the diversity of the host plant community and its affect on the decomposition environment. Using a biodiversity experiment with trees in which both functional and taxonomic diversity were explicitly manipulated independently, we tested the effects of the functional diversity and identity of the living trees separately and in combination with the functional diversity and identity of the decomposing litter on rates of litter decomposition and soil respiration. Plant traits, predominantly leaf chemical and physical traits, were correlated with both litter decomposition and soil respiration rates. Surface litter decomposition, quantified by mass loss in litterbags, was best explained by abundance-weighted mean trait values of tree species from which the litter was assembled (functional identity). In contrast, soil respiration, which includes decomposition of dissolved organic carbon and root respiration, was best explained by the variance in trait values of the host trees (functional diversity). This research provides insight into the effect of loss of tree diversity in forests on soil processes.

Spatial analyses show that they are rarely sympatric at local sites, and their distributions form a mosaic of patches where one is clearly dominant over hundreds of square kilometers. However, these morphospecies are also not genetically more similar when they are sympatric, indicating that  hybridization is probably not occurring. Given that these morphospecies are ecologically equivalent, strong assortative mating, reproductive interference and fast post-glacial recolonization may explain the origin and maintenance of these distributional patches across eastern North America.

The degree to which the phylogenetic relatedness in plant communities is in accord with limiting similarity has been little tested at the scale where the consequences of adaptive differentiation during speciation should be most evident: the scale of neighboring, congeneric plants within a community. To quantify species co-occurrence patterns in relation to environment, we sampled sedge species, their rooting level relative to the water table, and the water pH in 2,124 0.25 m¬≤ quadrats distributed across 29 subarctic fens in the central Labrador Peninsula. We estimated phylogenetic relationships using four DNA regions (ETS, ITS, matK, trnL-trnF) for all species of Carex (42), Eriophorum (6), and Trichophorum (2) in the region, of which 21, four, and two, respectively, occurred in the sampled fens. We demonstrate that closely related species of Carex are less likely to co-occur than expected by chance using 1) a probabilistic method to test the significance of pairwise co-occurrence patterns of species, and 2) linear mixed modeling to relate these patterns to phylogenetic relationships and ecological tolerances along gradients of substrate pH and rooting level in relation to the water table. The results also indicate that suites of species with significant mutual pairwise co-occurrence belong to distant lineages within the Cariceae-Dulichieae-Scirpeae clade of Cyperaceae and have stabilizing niche differences. We suggest that niche differentiation during the evolution and diversification of a clade of wetland Carex species over the past few million years, especially during the dynamic glacial cycles of the Pleistocene, has resulted in diverse sedge communities that share space and resources in harsh northern peatland habitats.",,,nuclear ribosomal spacers_Tertiary and Quaternary_Carex vaginata_limiting similarity_Carex chordorrhiza_community phylogenetics_Eriophorum viridicarinatum_Carex aquatilis_Carex rostrata_Carex gynocrates_Carex tsiangii_Carex pachygyna_Carex limosa_pairwise co-occurrence_ecophylogenetics_present_Carex livida_Carex heleonastes_Carex tenuiflora_Eriophorum chamissonis_Carex disperma_Carex trisperma_Carex pauciflora_niche differentiation;_Carex siderosticta_Coexistence theory_Eriophorum vaginatum_Carex echinata_Carex exilis_Carex magellanica_plastid DNA_Carex leptalea_Eriophorum angustifolium_Carex gibba_divergence times_Trichophorum cespitosum_Coexistence theory_Carex saxatilis_Carex rariflora_subarctic peatlands_quadrat sampling_Carex oligosperma_Carex canescens_Cyperaceae_Trichophorum alpinum_DNA alignment_Carex utriculata,,29/4/2017,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,H,repository,.csv,site IDs,no,Map,"Carex (42), Eriophorum (6), and Trichophorum (2) species",no,NA,no,no,700,no,presence-absence,,,,Systematic Botany,,,"Sampling locations without georreference, just localities name codes.

Estimates are often greatly improved when coupled with species distribution models (SDMs), which temper estimates in relation to occurrence.  SDMs can be constructed using from point locality data from a variety of sources including extensive monitoring data typically collected by citizen scientists. However, one potential issue with SDM is that these data oven have sampling bias. To avoid this potential bias, an approach using SDMs based on marsh bird monitoring program data collected by citizen scientists and other participants following protocols specifically designed to maximize detections of species of interest at locations representative of the species range. We then used the SDMs to refine isotopic assignments of breeding areas of autumn-migrating and wintering Sora (Porzana carolina), Virginia Rails (Rallus limicola), and Yellow Rails (Coturnicops noveboracensis) based on feathers collected from individuals caught at various locations in the United States from Minnesota south to Louisiana and South Carolina. Sora were assigned to an area that included much of the western U.S. and prairie Canada, covering parts of the Pacific, Central, and Mississippi Flyways. Yellow Rails were assigned to a broad area along Hudson and James Bay in northern Manitoba and Ontario, as well as smaller parts of Quebec, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, including parts of the Mississippi and Atlantic Flyways. Virginia Rails were from several discrete areas, including parts of Colorado, New Mexico, the central valley of California, and southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba in the Pacific and Central Flyways. Our study demonstrates extensive data from organized citizen science monitoring programs are especially useful for improving isotopic assignments of migratory connectivity in birds, which can ultimately lead to better informed management decisions and conservation actions.",,,Rallus limicola_rails_Coturnicops noveboracensis_porzana carolina_Migratory Connectivity_autumn migration,,6/6/2017,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,H,repository,".csv, other","site IDs, sample coordinates",NA,NA,"Porzana carolina, Rallus limicola, Coturnicops noveboracensis",1995-2015,"source publication text, dataset",20,NA,24706834,source publication text,distribution,,,,Journal of Avian Biology,,,Used count data from citizen science and monitoring programs to build the SDMs

Ballast water has been a principal pathway of nonindigenous species introduction to global ports for much of the 20th century. In an effort to reduce the scale of this pathway, and recognizing forthcoming global regulations that will supplant ballast water exchange (BWE) with ballast water treatment (BWT), we explore whether a combined hybrid treatment of BWE and chlorination (Cl) exceeds individual effects of either BWE or chlorination alone in reducing densities of bacteria, microplankton and macroplankton. 2. Five full-scale trials were conducted on an operational bulk carrier travelling between Canada and Brazil. 3. The hybrid treatment generally had the lowest final densities among all treatments for putative enterococci, Escherichia coli, and coliform bacteria, as well as microplankton and macroplankton, with the former two being synergistically lower than individual treatments alone. Microplankton abundance in the hybrid treatment was significantly but antagonistically reduced relative to individual treatments alone. Macroplankton final density was lowest in the hybrid treatment, though the interaction between treatments was not significant. 4. Synthesis and applications. In most cases the combined hybrid treatment of ballast water exchange (BWE) and chlorination reduced population densities of indicator organisms in ballast water below those proposed by the International Maritime Organization‚Äôs D-2 performance standards. BWE alone was often ineffective at reducing bacterial and macroplankton densities. Even when performance standards are implemented globally, continued use of BWE could further reduce risk of invasions to freshwater ecosystems that receive ballast water from foreign sources by accentuating the decline in propagule pressure and enhancing demographic constraints for putative invaders.",,,IMO-D2_coliform_Vibrio cholerae_Synergistic_ballast water treatment_additive_chlorine_alien species_nonindigenous_enterococci,,2/2/2015,,3,dryad,,,,no biological,no,X,,,,,,"Microplankton, bacteries",,,,,,,,,,,Journal of Applied Ecology,,,ballast water treatment

Population genetic comparisons across time periods can help elucidate temporal changes in populations and the processes responsible for the changes. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are wide-ranging carnivores and are currently increasing in abundance across an expanding range. Bobcat populations in New England have fluctuated in the past century in response to changes in their prey base, harvest pressure, and landscape development. We genotyped contemporary (2010‚Äì2017) and historic (1952‚Äì1964) bobcats from New England and Quebec, Canada at a suite of microsatellite loci and tested for differences in diversity, effective population size, and gene flow. Over 20 generations separated the sampling periods, and the intervening years were marked by drastic changes in land use and species management regimes. We found a general decrease in genetic diversity and differing population genetic structure through time. Effective population size decreased at the end of the historic period, coincident with a spike in harvest, but rebounded to greater numbers in the contemporary period. Our results suggest that bobcat populations in the region are robust, but development and range dynamics may play a significant role in population structure.

PLEASE NOTE: an additional file will be added to this data package: R script to calculate D and Gst for mtDNA (from a fasta file) and the associated p-values. It is also available here: <http://pleunipennings.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/r-code-for-calculating-jost-d-for-mtdna-sequences/>. ABSTRACT: The spatial structure of host-parasite coevolution is shaped by population structure and genetic diversity of the interacting species. We analyzed these population genetic parameters in three related ant species: the parasitic slavemaking ant Protomognathus americanus and its two host species Temnothorax longispinosus and T. curvispinosus. We sampled throughout their range, genotyped ants on six to eight microsatellite loci and an MtDNA sequence and found high levels of genetic variation and strong population structure in all three species. Interestingly, the most abundant species and primary host, T. longispinosus, is characterized by less structure, but lower local genetic diversity. Generally, differences between the species were small, and we conclude that they have similar evolutionary potentials. The coevolutionary interaction between this social parasite and its hosts may therefore be less influenced by divergent evolutionary potentials, but rather by varying selection pressures. We employed different methods to quantify and compare genetic diversity and structure between species and genetic markers. We found that Jost D is well suited for these comparisons, as long as mutation rates between markers and species are similar. If this is not the case, for example, when using MtDNA and microsatellites to study sex-specific dispersal, model-based inference should be used instead of descriptive statistics (such as D or GST). Using coalescent-based methods, we indeed found that males disperse much more than females, but this sex bias in dispersal differed between species. The findings of the different approaches with regard to genetic diversity and structure were in good accordance with each other.",,,Host-parasite interaction_Temnothorax longispinosus_Temnothorax curvispinosus_Protomagnatus americanus,,9/1/2015,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,".csv, .txt, .fas",site coordinates,no,Map,"Protomognathus americanus, Temnothorax longispinosus, Temnothorax curvispinosus",2002-2008,source publication text,6,no,no,no,"presence only, EBV genetic analysis",,,,Journal of Evolutionary Biology,,,Only one location in Quebec

Here, we present a unique combination of observations and experiments demonstrating that seed predation and soil properties strongly limit regeneration beyond the upper elevational range limit of sugar maple, a tree species of major economic importance. Most strikingly, regeneration beyond the range limit occurred almost exclusively when seeds were experimentally protected from predators. Regeneration from seed was depressed on soil from beyond the range edge when this soil was transplanted to sites within the range, with indirect evidence suggesting that fungal pathogens play a role. Non-climatic factors are clearly in need of careful attention when attempting to predict the biotic consequences of climate change.

Here, we used molecular parentage analysis to assess the reproductive success of wild- and hatchery- born Atlantic salmon over three consecutive years in a small river in Qu√©bec. Yearly restocking in this river follows a single generation of captive breeding. Among the adults returning to the river to spawn, between 11% and 41% each year were born in hatchery. Their relative reproductive success (RRS) was nearly half that of wild-born fish (0.55). RRS varied with life stage, being 0.71 for fish released at the fry stage and 0.42 for fish released as smolt. The lower reproductive success of salmon released as smolt was partly mediated by modification of the proportion of single-sea-winter/multi-sea-winter fish. Overall, our results suggest that modifications in survival and growth rates alter the life-history strategies of these fish at the cost of their reproductive success. Our results underline the potential fitness decrease, warn on long-term evolutionary consequences for the population of repeated stocking and support the adoption of more natural rearing conditions for captive juveniles and their release at a younger stage, such as unfed fry.",,,Captive Populations_Salmo salar,,8/10/2012,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.txt,no,geological feature name,geological feature name,Atlantic salmon,2002-2004,source publication text,2,no,no,no,EBV genetic analysis,,,,Evolutionary Applications,,,Sampling location mentioned in the link page.

We used a combination of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), nuclear microsatellites and spatial distribution modelling to study the population genetic structure of the boreal chickadee (Poecile hudsonicus), a resident passerine, and to investigate whether historical or contemporary barriers have influenced this northern species. MtDNA data showed evidence of eastern and western groups, with secondary admixture occurring in central Canada. This suggests that the boreal chickadee probably persisted in multiple glacial refugia, one in Beringia and at least one in the east. Palaeo-distribution modelling identified suitable habitat in Beringia (Alaska), Atlantic Canada and the southern United States, and correspond to divergence dates of 60‚Äì96‚Äâkya. Pairwise FST values for both mtDNA and microsatellites were significant for all comparisons involving Newfoundland, though mtDNA data suggest a more recent separation. Furthermore, unlike mtDNA data, nuclear data support population connectivity among the continental populations, possibly due to male-biased dispersal. Although both are significant, the isolation-by-distance signal is much stronger for mtDNA (r2=0.51) than for microsatellites (r2=0.05), supporting the hypothesis of male-biased dispersal.

Multiscale codependence analysis (MCA) quantifies the joint spatial distribution of a pair of variables in order to provide a spatially-explicit assessment of their relationships to one another. For the sake of simplicity, the original definition of MCA only considered a single response variable (e.g. a single species). However, that definition would limit the application of MCA when many response variables are studied jointly, for example when one wants to study the effect of the environment on the spatial organisation of a multi-species community in an explicit manner.
2. In the present paper, we generalize MCA to multiple response variables. We conducted a simulation study to assess the statistical properties (i.e. type I error rate and statistical power) of multivariate MCA (mMCA) and found that it had honest type I error rate and sufficient statistical power for practical purposes, even with modest sample sizes. We also exemplified mMCA by applying it to two ecological data sets.
3. The simulation study confirmed the adequacy of mMCA from a statistical standpoint: it has honest type I error rates and sufficient power to be useful in practice. Using mMCA, we were able to detect variation in fish community structure along the Doubs River (in France), which was associated with large spatial structures in the variation of physical and chemical variables related to water quality. Also, mMCA usefully described the spatial variation of an Oribatid mite community structure associated with a gradient of water content superimposed on various smaller-scale spatial features associated with vegetation cover in the peat blanket surrounding Lac Geai (in Qu√©bec, Canada).
4. In addition to demonstrating the soundness of mMCA in theory and practice, we further discuss the strengths and assumptions of mMCA and describe other potential scenarios where it would be helpful to biologists interested in assessing influence of environmental conditions on community structure in a spatially-explicit way.",,,Anthropocene_Oribatids_habitat modelling_spatial model_scale-dependent correlation,,2/8/2018,,3,dryad,,,,other,no,X,,,,,,NA,,,,,,,other,,,,Methods in Ecology and Evolution,,,simulations

Recently, evidence has emerged suggesting that intraspecific variation might have a potentially large role in driving functional community composition and response to environmental change. However, empirical evidence quantifying the respective importance of phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation relative to species turnover is still lacking. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment using a common herbaceous plant species (Oxalis montana) among low-, mid-, and high-elevation sites to first quantify the contributions of plasticity and genetic differentiation in driving intraspecific variation in three traits: height, specific leaf area and leaf area. We next compared the contributions of these intraspecific drivers of community trait-environment matching to that of species turnover, which had been previously assessed along the same elevational gradient. Plasticity was the dominant driver of intraspecific trait variation across elevation in all traits, with only a small contribution of genetic differentiation among populations. Local adaptation was not detected to a major extent along the gradient. Fitness components were greatest in O. montana plants with trait values closest to the local community-weighted means, thus supporting the common assumption that community-weighted mean trait values represent selective optima. Our results suggest that community-level trait responses to ongoing climate change should be mostly mediated by species turnover, even at the small spatial scale of our study, with an especially small contribution of evolutionary adaptation within species.",,,community trait variation_Intraspecific trait variation_Transplant experiment_Oxalis montana L.,,7/2/2019,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.csv,site IDs,no,administrative unit,Oxalis montana†,2012,source publication text,<1,no,20,no,presence only,,,,Ecology and Evolution,,,sampling location in the main publication

As patterns of structuring are products of historical and current demographics and gene flow, assessment of structure through time can yield an understanding of evolutionary dynamics acting on populations that are necessary to inform management. Recent dramatic population declines in hibernating bats in eastern North America from white-nose syndrome have prompted the need for information on movement dynamics for multiple bat species. We characterized population genetic structure of the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, at swarming sites in southeastern Canada using 9 nuclear microsatellites and a 292-bp region of the mitochondrial genome. Analyses of FST, Œ¶ST, and Bayesian clustering (STRUCTURE) found weak levels of genetic structure among swarming sites for the nuclear and mitochondrial genome (Global FST = 0.001, P < 0.05, Global Œ¶ST = 0.045, P < 0.01, STRUCTURE K = 1) suggesting high contemporary gene flow. Hierarchical AMOVA also suggests little structuring at a regional (provincial) level. Metrics of nuclear genetic structure were not found to differ between males and females suggesting weak asymmetries in gene flow between the sexes. However, a greater degree of mitochondrial structuring does support male-biased dispersal long term. Demographic analyses were consistent with past population growth and suggest a population expansion occurred from approximately 1250 to 12,500 BP, following Pleistocene deglaciation in the region. Our study suggests high gene flow and thus a high degree of connectivity among bats that visit swarming sites whereby mainland areas of the region may be best considered as one large gene pool for management and conservation.",,,Myotis lucifugus_Population Expansion_Holocene_Chiroptera,,10/9/2015,,3,dryad,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.txt,no,no,Map,Myotis lucifugus,2009-2011,source publication text,2,no,no,no,EBV genetic analysis,,,,Ecology and Evolution,,,approximate sampling locations in the main publication:  geographic coordinates and names are not used due to the sensitive nature of swarming and hibernation sites

Laboratory research on this species requires a source of adult and larval insects that are of the same fitness as those present in the wild. Production of adult emerald ash borer relies on flushing adults from logs which are subject to cold storage for some period prior to use. The effect of this storage on the number of insects emerging or the fitness of those that emerge has not been investigated. We subjected logs of EAB-infested white ash, Fraxinus americana L. to 7‚Äì14 month of cold storage and quantified the number of insects that emerged, time to emergence, and the body condition of adults as a measure of fitness. Body condition was evaluated using Soxhlet fat extraction and water weight. No published methods for Soxhlet fat extraction were available for this species so we developed extraction protocols. The number of insects emerging decreased with time, but fitness (i.e., fat content, water content) did not decrease. Time to emergence did increase but only in the longest-storage treatment while a comparison of male versus female emergence provides evidence for protandry in emerald ash borer. Rearing programs for emerald ash borer using wood from cold storage should adjust the amount used to produce a given number of insects but the quality of those individuals emerging will not be affected. We suggest that those insects that perished during storage were of lower quality when entering diapause and thus would serve as poor-quality host in rearing programs for natural enemies of emerald ash borer. These data also provide evidence for one pathway of introduction for emerald ash borer, suggesting that refrigeration in transit was required for EAB to remain viable and establish its beachhead in North America.",,,fat content_protandry_Rearing_body condition_water content_Propagule pressure_Agrilus planipennis_Holocene_Fraxinus,,4/12/2018,,3,dryad,,,,location,no,X,repository,,,,,Agrilus planipennis,,,,,,,other,,,,Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata,,,Ontario

Mass-flowering crops are only in bloom for a few weeks and unable to support bee populations that persist throughout the year. Farm fields and orchards that flower in succession potentially can extend the availability of floral resources for pollinators. However, it is unclear whether the same bee species or genera will forage from one crop to the next, which bees specialize on particular crops, and to what degree inter-crop visitation patterns will be mediated by landscape context. We therefore studied local- and landscape-level drivers of bee diversity and species turnover in apple orchards, blueberry fields and raspberry fields that bloom sequentially in southern Quebec, Canada. Despite the presence of high bee species turnover, orchards and small fruit fields complemented each other phenologically by supporting two bee genera essential to their pollination: mining bees (Andrena spp.) and bumble bees (Bombus spp.). A number of bee species specialized on apple, blueberry or raspberry blossoms, suggesting that all three crops could be used to promote regional bee diversity. Bee diversity (rarefied richness, wild bee abundance) was highest across crops in landscapes containing hedgerows, meadows and suburban areas that provide ancillary nesting and floral resources throughout the spring and summer.

Estimating <i>h</i><sup>2</sup> in free-ranging populations is challenging due to the need for pedigrees; genomic-relatedness matrices (GRMs) circumvent this need and can be implemented in nearly any system where phenotypic and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data are available. We estimated the heritability of five body and three antler traits in a free-ranging population of white-tailed deer (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>) on Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada. We generated classic and robust GRMs from &gt;10,000 SNPs: hind foot length, dressed body mass and peroneus muscle mass had high <i>h</i><sup>2 </sup>values of 0.62, 0.44 and 0.55, respectively. Heritability in male-only antler features ranged from 0.07 to 0.33 and had high standard errors. We explored the influence of filtering by minor allele frequency and data completion on <i>h</i><sup>2</sup>: GRMs derived from fewer SNPs had reduced <i>h</i><sup>2</sup> estimates and the relatedness coefficients significantly deviated from those generated with more SNPs. As a corollary, we discussed limitations to the application of GRMs in the wild, notably how skewed GRMs, specifically many unrelated individuals, can increase variance around <i>h</i><sup>2</sup> estimates. This is the first study to estimate <i>h</i><sup>2 </sup>on a free-ranging population of white-tailed deer and should be informative for breeding designs and management as these traits should respond to selection.</p>

While some threats to shorebirds are widespread (e.g. habitat alteration), others are regional and may affect specific populations. Lesser Yellowlegs (<i>Tringa flavipes</i>) are long-distance migrants that breed across the North American boreal biome and have declined in abundance by 60-80% since the 1970s. The documented harvest of Lesser Yellowlegs in the Caribbean and northeastern South America during southward migration is a possible limiting factor for the species, but it is unknown to what extent birds from different breeding origins may be affected. To address the question of differential occurrence in harvest zones during southward migration, we used PinPoint GPS Argos transmitters to track the southward migrations of 85 adult Lesser Yellowlegs from across the species‚Äô breeding range and 80¬∞ of longitude from Anchorage, Alaska, USA to the Mingan Archipelago, Quebec, Canada. We classified migratory locations as inside or outside three zones with high levels of harvest (Caribbean, coastal Guianas, and coastal Brazil) and then fit generalized additive mixed models to estimate the probability of occurrence of Lesser Yellowlegs in harvest zones according to their breeding origin. Individuals from the Eastern Canada population had a higher probability of occurrence within one or more harvest zones and remained in those zones longer than individuals breeding in Alaska and western Canada.

However, delineation of a species lifelong thermal niche remains technically challenging. Lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>) survival and productivity are recognised as being tightly linked to a somewhat restricted thermal habitat. The factors guiding temperature selection during each life stage remain poorly understood.</p>

<p class=""Text"" style=""text-align:justify;""><b>2.</b> In this study, we tested the significant factors controlling the realised thermal niche of lake trout from two southern Quebec small boreal lakes that experienced supplementation stocking during the last 20 years. We used oxygen stable isotope (Œ¥<sup>18</sup>O) thermometry of otolith calcium carbonates (aragonite) using secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to estimate experienced lifelong temperatures. We investigated the thermal habitat of lake trout with known genotypes (local, hybrid and stocked).</p>

<p class=""Text"" style=""text-align:justify;""><b>3</b>. Ontogeny and genetic origin influenced temperature selection in both studied lake trout populations. Young-of-the-year consistently used warmer, shallower habitats (10.7 ¬± 2.6¬∞C, 7.5¬†m depth) prior to a juvenile transition to colder and deeper waters (8.5 ¬± 3.3¬∞C, 10 m depth). Stocked lake trout, originating from a genetically distinct ecotype, exhibited a more variable thermal niche, with some individuals consistently using warmer habitat (10.4 ¬± 1¬∞C) than local fish. Their hybrid progeny also occupied a warmer thermal niche, intermediate to the parental strains. We propose that increased fat content and genetic origin are potential explanatory factors for warmer temperature use.</p>

https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%3A10.5061%2Fdryad.sbcc2fr4j,Data from: Influence of habitat availability and fire disturbance on the northern range boundary of eastern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.),"<h4>Aim</h4>

<p>Non-climatic constraints on species northern range boundaries are often overlooked in attempts to predict climate-induced range shifts. Here, we examined the effects of habitat availability and fire disturbance on the distribution of eastern white cedar (<i>Thuja occidentalis</i> L.) at the northern boundary of its range.</p>

<h4>Location</h4>

<p>North-western Quebec, Canada (46-51¬∞ N and 74-79¬∞ W)</p>

<h4>Methods</h4>

<p>We used forest inventory data (<i>n</i>=4,987) to characterize white-cedar habitat based on edaphic and topographic conditions at sampled sites along a 600-km latitudinal gradient. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to assess habitat similarity of sites in the south, where white-cedar stands are abundant, and sites in the north, where white-cedar stands are rare. We constructed ensemble white cedar distribution models based on habitat variables in the south and compared ensemble forecast projections of white cedar in the north with observed occurrences to determine if habitat availability was limiting. We independently estimated the age of white-cedar stands and adjacent stands without white cedar along the gradient. ANOVA was performed to test the age difference between white-cedar and adjacent stands to determine if the location of white-cedar stands was influenced by disturbance, primarily stand-replacing fire.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>Habitat availability was not limiting the distribution of eastern white cedar at its northern range boundary. White cedar did not occupy most sites with suitable habitat in the north, suggesting that other factors prevent white cedar from establishing more stands northward. White-cedar stands were older than adjacent stands without white cedar all along the gradient, but the difference was more pronounced in the north. This suggests that white-cedar stands in the north are restricted to undisturbed areas.</p>

<h4>Main conclusions</h4>

<p>Fire disturbance, more than habitat availability, limits the distribution of white cedar at its northern range boundary. Projections of white cedar distribution under climate change that ignore fire could overestimate the ability of warming temperatures to extend its northern range limit.</p>

Glossy buckthorn has impacts on the biodiversity and productivity of invaded forests. Currently, we do not know much about the species‚Äô ecology and no thorough study of its distribution in temperate forests has been performed yet. As is often the case with invasive plant species, the phenology of glossy buckthorn differs from that of other indigenous plant species found in invaded communities. In the forests of eastern Canada, the main phenological difference is a delay in the shedding of glossy buckthorn leaves, which occurs later in the fall than for other indigenous tree species found in that region. Therefore, our objective was to use that phenological characteristic to map the spatial distribution of glossy buckthorn over a portion of southern Qu√©bec, Canada, using remote sensing-based approaches. We achieved this by applying a linear temporal unmixing model to a time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images to create a map of the probability of the occurrence of glossy buckthorn for the study area. The map resulting from the temporal unmixing model shows an agreement of 69% with field estimates of glossy buckthorn occurrence measured in 121 plots distributed over the study area. Glossy buckthorn mapping accuracy was limited by evergreen species and by the spectral and spatial resolution of the Landsat 8 OLI.",,,,,2020-03-13,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,NA,NA,Map,Frangula alnus,2015,,,,3200,,density (cover),,,,Remote Sensing,2020,,invasive species
https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.201216,Policy changes and physicians opting out from Medicare in Quebec: an interrupted time-series analysis,"BACKGROUND: In all Canadian provinces, physicians can decide to either bill the provincial public system (opt in) or work privately and bill patients directly (opt out). We hypothesized that 2 policy events were associated with an increase in physicians opting out in Quebec. METHODS: The 2 policy events of interest were the 2005 Supreme Court of Canada ruling on Chaoulli v. Quebec and a regulatory clampdown forbidding double billing that was implemented by Quebec‚Äôs government in 2017. We used interrupted time-series analyses of the Quebec government‚Äôs yearly list of physicians who chose to opt out from 1994 to 2019 to analyze the relation between these events and physician billing status. RESULTS: The number of family physicians who opted out increased from 9 in 1994 to 347 in 2019. Opting out increased after the Chaoulli ruling, and our analysis suggested that between 2005 and 2019, 284 more family physicians opted out than if pre-Chaoulli trends had continued. The number of specialist physicians who opted out rose from 23 in 1994 to 150 in 2019. Our analysis suggested that an additional 69 specialist physicians opted out after the 2017 clampdown on double billing than previous trends would have predicted. INTERPRETATION: We found that the number of physicians who opted out increased in Quebec, and increases after 2 policy actions suggest an association with these policy interventions. Opting out decisions are likely important inputs into decision-making by physicians, which, in turn may influence the provision of publicly funded health care.",,,,,2021-02-16,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,no biological,no,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-biological related.

https://doi.org/10.1111/ECOG.05253,Climate extreme variables generated using monthly time‚Äêseries data improve predicted distributions of plant species,"Extreme weather can have significant impacts on plant species demography; however, most studies have focused on responses to a single or small number of extreme events. Long-term patterns in climate extremes, and how they have shaped contemporary distributions, have rarely been considered or tested. BIOCLIM variables that are commonly used in correlative species distribution modelling studies cannot be used to quantify climate extremes, as they are generated using long-term averages and therefore do not describe year-to-year, temporal variability. We evaluated the response of 37 plant species to base climate (long-term means, equivalent to BIOCLIM variables), variability (standard deviations) and extremes of varying return intervals (defined using quantiles) based on historical observations. These variables were generated using fine-grain (approx. 250 m), time-series temperature and precipitation data for the hottest, coldest and driest months over 39 years. Extremes provided significant additive improvements in model performance compared to base climate alone and were more consistent than variability across all species. Models that included extremes frequently showed notably different mapped predictions relative to those using base climate alone, despite often small differences in statistical performance as measured as a summary across sites. These differences in spatial patterns were most pronounced at the predicted range margins, and reflect the influence of coastal proximity, continentality, topography and orographic barriers on climate extremes. Species occupying hotter and drier locations that are exposed to severe maximum temperature extremes were associated with better predictive performance when modelled using extremes. Understanding how plant species have historically responded to climate extremes may provide valuable insights into our understanding of contemporary distributions and help to make more accurate predictions under a changing climate.",,,,,2021-02-02,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Australia

The dense time series and a wide swath of Sentinel-2 data provided the opportunity to map tree species accurately and in a timely manner over a large area. Many current studies have applied machine learning (ML) algorithms combined with Sentinel-2 images to classify tree species, but it is still unclear, which algorithm is more effective in the automotive extraction of tree species. In this study, five ML algorithms were compared to identify the composition of tree species with multitemporal Sentinel-2 images in the JianShe forest farm, Northeast China. Three major types of deep neural networks [Conv1D, AlexNet, and long short-term memory (LSTM)] were tested to classify Sentinel-2 time series, which represent three disparate but effective strategies to apply sequential data. The other two models are support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which are renowned for extensive adoption and high performance for various remote sensing applications. The results show that the overall accuracy of neural network models is better than that of SVM and RF. The Conv1D model had the highest classification accuracy (84.19%), followed by the LSTM model (81.52%), and the AlexNet model (76.02%). For non-neural network models, RF's classification accuracy (79.04%) is higher than that of SVM (72.79%), but lower than that of Conv1D and LSTM. Therefore, the deep neural networks combined with multitemporal Sentinel-2 images can efficiently improve the accuracy of tree species classification.",,,,,2021,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,China
https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13142716,How Spatial Resolution Affects Forest Phenology and Tree-Species Classification Based on Satellite and Up-Scaled Time-Series Images,"The distribution of forest tree species provides crucial data for regional forest management and ecological research. Although medium-high spatial resolution remote sensing images are widely used for dynamic monitoring of forest vegetation phenology and species identification, the use of multiresolution images for similar applications remains highly uncertain. Moreover, it is necessary to explore to what extent spectral variation is responsible for the discrepancies in the estimation of forest phenology and classification of various tree species when using up-scaled images. To clarify this situation, we studied the forest area in Harqin Banner in northeast China by using year-round multiple-resolution time-series images (at four spatial resolutions: 4, 10, 16, and 30 m) and eight phenological metrics of four deciduous forest tree species in 2018, to explore potential impacts of relevant results caused by various resolutions. We also investigated the effect of using up-scaled time-series images by comparing the corresponding results that use pixel-aggregation algorithms with the four spatial resolutions. The results indicate that both phenology and classification accuracy of the dominant forest tree species are markedly affected by the spatial resolution of time-series remote sensing data (p < 0.05): the spring phenology of four deciduous forest tree species first rises and then falls as the image resolution varies from 4 to 30 m; similarly, the accuracy of tree species classification increases as the image resolution varies from 4 to 10 m, and then decreases as the image resolution gradually falls to 30 m (p < 0.05). Therefore, there remains a profound discrepancy between the results obtained by up-scaled and actual remote sensing data at the given spatial resolutions (p < 0.05). The results also suggest that combining phenological metrics and time-series NDVI data can be applied to identify the regional dominant tree species across different spatial resolutions, which would help advance the use of multiscale time-series satellite data for forest resource management.",,,,,2021-07-10,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no, X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,China
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10841-021-00353-4,"Moth species richness and diversity decline in a 30-year time series in Norway, irrespective of species‚Äô latitudinal range extent and habitat","
 
 Insects are reported to be in decline around the globe, but long-term datasets are rare. The causes of these trends are elusive, with changes in land use and climate among the top candidates. Yet if species traits can predict rates of population change, this can help identify underlying mechanisms. If climate change is important, for example, high-latitude species may decline as temperate species expand. Land use changes, however, may impact species that rely on certain habitats.
 
 
 We present 30 years of moth captures (comprising 97,032 individuals of 808 species) from a site in southeast Norway to test for population trends that are correlated with species traits. We use time series analyses and joint species distribution models combined with local climate and habitat data.
 
 
 Species richness declined by 8.2% per decade and total abundance appeared to decline as well (‚àí9.4%, p = 0.14) but inter-annual variability was high. One-fifth of species declined, although 6% increased. Winter and summer weather were correlated with annual rates of abundance change for many species. Opposite to general expectation, many species responded negatively to higher summer and winter temperatures. Surprisingly, species‚Äô northern range limits and the habitat in which their food plants grew were not strong predictors of their time trends or their responses to climatic variation. Complex and indirect effects of both land use and climate change may play a role in these declines.
 
 
 Our results provide additional evidence for long-term declines in insect abundance. The multifaceted causes of population changes may limit the ability of species traits to reveal which species are most at risk.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.p2kf0,Data from: Do seaducks minimise the flightless period?: inter- and intra-specific comparisons of remigial moult,"Remigial moult is one of the crucial events in the annual life cycle of waterfowl as it is energetically costly, lasts several weeks, and is a period of high vulnerability due to flightlessness. In waterfowl, remigial moult can be considered as an energy-predation trade-off, meaning that heavier individuals would minimise the flightless period by increasing feather growth rate and energy expenditure. Alternatively, they could reduce body mass at the end of this period, thereby reducing wing-loading to increase flight capability. We studied timing of remigial moult, primary growth rates, flightlessness duration, and the pattern of body mass variation in 5 species of captive seaducks (Melanitta fusca, M. perspicillata, Clangula hyemalis, Histrionicus histrionicus, and Somateria mollissima) ranging in size from 0.5 to 2.0 kg. Their feather growth rates weakly increased with body mass (M0.059) and no correlation was found at the intra-specific level. Consequently, heavier seaduck species and especially heavier individuals had a longer flightless period. Although birds had access to food ad libidum, body mass first increased then decreased, the latter coinciding with maximum feather growth rate. Level of body mass when birds regained flight ability was similar to level observed at the beginning of remigial moult, suggesting they were not using a strategic reduction of body mass to reduce the flightlessness duration. We suggest that the moulting strategy of seaducks may be the result of a compromise between using an intense moult strategy (simultaneous moult) and a low feather growth rate without prejudice to feather quality. Despite the controlled captive status of the studied seaducks, all five species as well as both sexes within each species showed timing of moult reflecting that of wild birds, suggesting there is a genetic component acting to shape moult timing within wild birds.",,,[],,2015-07-10,,0,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,X,repository,,NA,NA,NA,5 seaduck species,,,,,,,other,,,,Plos One,2014,,

The vast geographical distribution and behavioural variability of caribou warranted the development and validation of an appropriate conservation tool for managers in eastern Canada. We developed a habitat suitability model for boreal caribou in Qu√©bec by integrating expert knowledge into a hierarchical analysis. We elicited responses from 14 experts on caribou ecology to determine the best spatiotemporal scales of application, the relative importance of habitat variables, the zone of influence of human infrastructure, and the parameterization of the model. Based on this input, we built the model using 8 habitat categories and 3 human infrastructure variables. Experts identified mature conifer-dominated forests and open lichen woodlands as the most important vegetation categories for boreal caribou, whereas density of and proximity to paved roads, forest roads, and mines decreased habitat quality. We mapped the resulting model over the entire province of Qu√©bec (up to the northern forest allocation limit), and validated it using independent GPS telemetry datasets acquired in 3 distinct regions. Our model predicted that habitat suitability was highest in the northeastern part of our study area, where timber harvest activities and roads were virtually absent. Conversely, southern parts of Qu√©bec were generally unsuitable for boreal caribou.

<p><strong>R&Eacute;SUM&Eacute;</strong></p>

<p>Les milieux humides sont des environnements dynamiques et vuln&eacute;rables. Leur conservation est vitale pour la p&eacute;rennit&eacute; des diff&eacute;rents services &eacute;cologiques rendus et de la biodiversit&eacute; qui y abonde, notamment la faune.</p>

<p>Par l&#39;entremise de la Loi sur l&#39;am&eacute;nagement durable du territoire forestier (et le R&egrave;glement sur l&#39;am&eacute;nagement durable des for&ecirc;ts du domaine de l&#39;&Eacute;tat), de la Loi sur la Qualit&eacute; de l&#39;environnement et de la Loi concernant la conservation de milieux humides et hydriques, le Gouvernement du Qu&eacute;bec assure un cadre l&eacute;gal de protection des milieux humides forestiers. Toutefois, pour assurer la conservation et la mise en valeur de ces milieux essentiels et des esp&egrave;ces qui en d&eacute;pendent, des connaissances sur leur importance, leurs emplacements et leurs caract&eacute;ristiques restent n&eacute;cessaires. Ce type d&rsquo;informations est d&rsquo;ailleurs crucial pour l&rsquo;ensemble des MRC du Qu&eacute;bec qui doivent l&eacute;galement transmettre leurs plans r&eacute;gionaux des milieux humides et hydriques au ministre de l&rsquo;Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques (MELCC) au plus tard en juin 2022 et les tenir &agrave; jour par la suite.</p>

<p>En 2008, une &eacute;quipe de chercheurs codirig&eacute;e par Marcel Darveau (Canards Illimit&eacute;s et Universit&eacute; Laval) et Louis Imbeau (Universit&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec en Abitibi-T&eacute;miscamingue), a produit une carte des milieux humides &agrave; &eacute;chelle moyenne, avec des unit&eacute;s minimales cartographiables de 1 ha pour les milieux ouverts et 4 ha pour les milieux bois&eacute;s, &agrave; partir de la carte &eacute;coforesti&egrave;re du 3e inventaire d&eacute;cennal. Cette carte couvrait 540&nbsp;000&nbsp;km&sup2;, i.e. tout le Qu&eacute;bec au sud du 51e parall&egrave;le. Elle a &eacute;t&eacute; largement utilis&eacute;e par des am&eacute;nagistes de faune et du territoire, ainsi que des chercheurs dans ces domaines. L&rsquo;approche novatrice de cartographie bas&eacute;e sur l&rsquo;extraction d&rsquo;informations issue de la carte &eacute;coforesti&egrave;re a &eacute;t&eacute; reprise par diff&eacute;rentes organisations gouvernementales, notamment le MELCC et l&rsquo;Institut de la statistique du Qu&eacute;bec, respectivement pour &eacute;tablir une carte des milieux humides potentiels en vue de caract&eacute;risations sur le terrain et pour le suivi du Compte des terres du Qu&eacute;bec. Toutefois, ces outils r&eacute;cents ne comblent pas le besoin d&rsquo;une cartographie bas&eacute;e sur une norme uniforme pour la planification syst&eacute;matique de la conservation de la biodiversit&eacute; et des services &eacute;cologiques, notamment les mod&egrave;les de distribution d&rsquo;esp&egrave;ces fauniques.</p>

<p>Le pr&eacute;sent projet, subventionn&eacute; par la Fondation de la faune et r&eacute;alis&eacute; en partenariat avec Ouranos et Mat&eacute;riaux innovants Rayonier, avait pour but de mettre &agrave; jour notre cartographie de 2008 en regard de l&rsquo;approche de classification et des donn&eacute;es sources (4e inventaire forestier d&eacute;cennal version 2018), puis d&rsquo;&eacute;valuer sa concordance avec des donn&eacute;es de terrain et finalement de diffuser l&rsquo;outil.</p>

<p>La classification d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e comporte trois grandes composantes&nbsp;:</p>

<ol>
	<li>La classification des milieux humides proprement dite, respectant la structure g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l&rsquo;Inventaire canadien des milieux humides, avec 14 classes et sous-classes surfaciques plus 2 classes lin&eacute;aires (figure ci-dessous). Au premier niveau, on distingue les milieux humides organiques, min&eacute;raux et indiff&eacute;renci&eacute;s, puis au niveaux suivants la classe (ex. bog, fen) et le type (ex. arborescent, ouvert).</li>

Raccoon rabies variant (RRV) is a zoonosis of concern for humans because its main vector, the raccoon (Procyon lotor), is found near residential areas. In Qu√©bec, Canada, all cases of RRV found in raccoons since 2006 were detected on the eastern side of the Richelieu River, suggesting that this river acts as a barrier to gene flow and thus, the potential for RRV to spread. The objectives of this study were to characterize the genetic structure of raccoon populations and assess the effect of the Richelieu River on the population structure in southern Qu√©bec, Canada. We also evaluated whether RRV spread potential differed between sex and at a larger spatial scale. Our analyses revealed a weak signal of genetic differentiation among individuals located on each side of the Richelieu River. At a larger spatial scale, genetic structuring was weak. Our results suggest that rivers might not always efficiently restrain raccoon movements and spread of RRV. We suggest that the difference in genetic structure found between sexes can be partly explained by male movements during the breeding season in winter, when ice bridges allow passage over most rivers in Qu√©bec.",,,Procyon lotor_Disease Biology_Wildlife Management,,2011-12-20,,0,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,M,repository,.xlsx,sample coordinates,geological feature name,"Map, geological feature name",Procyon lotor,2008-2009,source publication text,1,NA,21000,source publication text,"presence only, EBV genetic analysis",,,,Evolutionary Applications,,,

However, wind measured by satellite scatterometers and buoys are spatially and temporally coarse, particularly in coastal areas. We deployed small global positioning system units on soaring seabirds to record their tracks. Seabirds were accelerated by tail winds or slowed down by head winds during flight, so their flight speed changed in relation to wind speed and direction. Taking advantage of these changes in flight speed, we reliably estimated wind speed and direction experienced by the seabirds. The wind observed by soaring seabird's tracks complemented the conventional observation gaps in terms of both time and space, suggesting the possibility of using soaring seabirds as a living anemometer.",,,dynamic soaring_Laysan albatross_streaked shearwater_wandering albatross_bio-logging_GPS_satellite scatterometer,,2017-07-11,,1,zenodo,,,,location,no,X,,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Japan, Hawaii, Inidan ocean"
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.rq3jc84,Data from: Synchrony is more than its top-down and climatic parts: interacting Moran effects on phytoplankton in British seas,"Large-scale spatial synchrony is ubiquitous in ecology. We examined 56 years of data representing chlorophyll density in 26 areas in British seas monitored by the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey. We used wavelet methods to disaggregate synchronous fluctuations by timescale and determine that drivers of synchrony include both biotic and abiotic variables. We tested these drivers for statistical significance by comparison with spatially synchronous surrogate data. We generated timescale-specific models, accounting for 61% of long-timescale (&gt; 4yrs) synchrony in a chlorophyll density index, but only 3% of observed short-timescale (&lt; 4yrs) synchrony. The dominant source of long-timescale chlorophyll synchrony was closely related to sea surface temperature, through a Moran effect, though likely via complex oceanographic mechanisms. The top-down action of Calanus finmarchicus predation enhances this environmental synchronising mechanism and interacts with it non-additively to produce more long-timescale synchrony than top-down and climatic drivers would produce independently. Thus we demonstrate interaction effects between Moran drivers of synchrony, a new mechanism for synchrony that may affect many ecosystems at large spatial scales.",,,Temora longicornis_Euphausiacea_Nitzschia delicatissima_Centropages typicus_Ceratium tripos_Oithona spp._Ceratium furca_Para-pseudocalanus spp._Pseudocalanus elongatus_Metridia lucens_Calanus finmarchicus_Calanus I-IV_Rhizosolenia styliformis_Thalassiosira spp._Para-pseudocalanus spp._Ceratium macroceros_Calanus helgolandicus_Nitzschia seriata_Echinoderm larvae_Rhizosolenia alata alata_Acartia spp._spatial synchrony_Wavelets_Decapoda larvae_Ceratium fusus,,2019-03-29,,1,zenodo,,,,location,no,X,,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,British seas
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.r5d10,Data from: Model adequacy and microevolutionary explanations for stasis in the fossil record,"Long-term phenotypic stasis is frequently observed in the fossil record, but not readily predicted from microevolutionary theory. To test competing explanations for stasis on macroevolutionary time scales we need reliably estimated parameters from appropriate evolutionary models that adequately describe the evolutionary trait dynamics. Here, we develop tests to assess the adequacy of the most commonly used stasis model in evolutionary biology and apply them to time series of phenotypic traits from fossil lineages. Of the 572 fossil time series we analyzed from the literature, 263 times series showed a better fit to the stasis model relative to alternative models, but only 172 of those fitted the stasis model both in relative and absolute terms. The estimated trait variances from these 172 time series do not correlate with rough proxies of effective population size. Our preliminary investigation of the fixed-optimum hypothesis hence fails to give empirical support to the idea that genetic drift around a constant trait optimum is an explanation for stasis in the fossil record. We argue that optima following stationary processes on the adaptive landscape is a viable hypothesis for stasis that needs further investigation. We end by discussing how investigations of model adequacy can be a valuable approach for increasing our understanding of the dynamics of the adaptive landscape on macroevolutionary time scales.",,,fossil time series_Paleontology,,2017-11-09,,1,zenodo,,,,other,no,X,,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fossil records from the literature
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.td065,Data from: Temporally and spatially partitioned behaviours of spinner dolphins: implications for resilience to human disturbance,"Selective forces shape the evolution of wildlife behavioural strategies and influence the spatial and temporal partitioning of behavioural activities to maximize individual fitness. Globally, wildlife is increasingly exposed to human activities which may affect their behavioural activities. The ability of wildlife to compensate for the effects of human activities may have implications for their resilience to disturbance. Resilience theory suggests that behavioural systems which are constrained in their repertoires are less resilient to disturbance than flexible systems. Using behavioural time-series data, we show that spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) spatially and temporally partition their behavioural activities on a daily basis. Specifically, spinner dolphins were never observed foraging during daytime, where resting was the predominant activity. Travelling and socializing probabilities were higher in early mornings and late afternoons when dolphins were returning from or preparing for nocturnal feeding trips, respectively. The constrained nature of spinner dolphin behaviours suggests they are less resilient to human disturbance than other cetaceans. These dolphins experience the highest exposure rates to human activities ever reported for any cetaceans. Over the last 30 years human activities have increased significantly in Hawaii, but the spinner dolphins still inhabit these bays. Recent abundance estimates (2011 and 2012) however, are lower than all previous estimates (1979‚Äì1981, 1989‚Äì1992 and 2003), indicating a possible long-term impact. Quantification of the spatial and temporal partitioning of wildlife behavioural schedules provides critical insight for conservation measures that aim to mitigate the effects of human disturbance.",,,behavioural strategies_conservation measures_Human Activities,,2016-11-04,,1,zenodo,,,,location,no,X,,,NA,NA,NA,Stenella longirostris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hawaii
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.n8d6s43,Data from: Occasional long-distance dispersal increases spatial synchrony of population cycles,"1.	Spatially-separated populations of the same species often exhibit correlated fluctuations in abundance, a phenomenon known as spatial synchrony. Dispersal can generate spatial synchrony. In nature, most individuals disperse short distances with a minority dispersing long distances. The effect of occasional long-distance dispersal on synchrony is untested, and theoretical predictions are contradictory. Occasional long-distance dispersal might either increase both overall synchrony and the spatial scale of synchrony, or reduce them.
2.	We conducted a protist microcosm experiment to test whether occasional long-distance dispersal increases or decreases overall synchrony and the spatial scale of synchrony.
3.	We assembled replicate 15-patch ring metapopulations of the protist predator Euplotes patella and its protist prey Tetrahymena pyriformis. All metapopulations experienced the same dispersal rate, but differed in dispersal distance. Some metapopulations experienced strictly short-distance (nearest neighbor) dispersal, others experienced a mixture of short- and long-distance dispersal.
4.	Occasional long distance dispersal increased overall spatial synchrony and the spatial scale of synchrony for both prey and predators, though the effects were not statistically significant for predators. As predicted by theory, dispersal generated spatial synchrony by entraining the phases of the predator-prey cycles in different patches, a phenomenon known as phase locking.
5.	Our results are consistent with theoretical models predicting that occasional long-distance dispersal increases spatial synchrony. However, our results also illustrate that the spatial scale of synchrony need not match the spatial scale of the processes generating synchrony. Even strictly short-distance dispersal maintained high spatial synchrony for many generations at spatial scales much longer than the dispersal distance, thanks to phase locking.",,,Euplotes patella_Euplotes_Tetrahymena_dispersal kernel_Tetrahymena pyriformis_Protists_spatial synchrony_microcosms,,2019-09-07,,1,zenodo,,,,not in the field,no,X,,,NA,NA,NA,Protists,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cultures with protists
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.733tn,Data from: Parasites driving host diversity: incidence of disease correlated with Daphnia clonal turnover,"According to the Red Queen hypothesis, clonal diversity in asexual populations could be maintained by negative frequency-dependant selection by co-evolving parasites. If common clones are selected against and rare clones gain a concomitant advantage, we expect that clonal turnover should be faster during parasite epidemics than between them. We tested this hypothesis exploring field data of the Daphnia ‚Äì Caullerya host-parasite system. The clonal make-up and turnover of the Daphnia host population was tracked with high temporal resolution from 1998 until 2013, using first allozyme markers and later microsatellite markers. Significant differences in the clonal composition between random and infected sub-samples of Daphnia populations were detected on six of seven tested occasions, confirming genetic specificity of the host-parasite interaction in this system. We used time series analysis to compare the rates of host clonal turnover to the incidence of parasitism, and found that Caullerya prevalence was significantly associated with microsatellite-based clonal turnover. As alternate hypotheses, we further tested whether turnover was related to a variety of biotic, abiotic, and host demographic parameters. Other significant correlates of turnover were cyanobacterial biomass and (weakly) temperature. Overall, parasitism seems to be a strong driver of host clonal turnover, in support of the Red Queen hypothesis.",,,Red Queen_Coevolution_Caullerya,,2017-12-07,,1,zenodo,,,,location,no,X,,,NA,NA,NA,"Daphnia, Caullerya",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Switzerland
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.nh43g,Data from: Density-mediated carry-over effects explain variation in breeding output across time in a seasonal population,"In seasonal environments, where density dependence can operate throughout the annual cycle, vital rates are typically considered to be a function of the number of individuals at the beginning of each season. However, variation in density in the previous season could also cause surviving individuals to be in poor physiological condition, which could carry over to influence individual success in the following season. We examine this hypothesis using replicated populations of Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruitfly, over 23 non-overlapping generations with distinct breeding and non-breeding seasons. We found that the density at the beginning of the non-breeding season negatively affected the fresh weight of individuals that survived the non-breeding season and resulted in a 25% decrease in per capita breeding output among those that survived to the next season to breed. At the population level, per capita breeding output was best explained by a model that incorporated density at the beginning of the previous non-breeding season (carry-over effect, COE) and density at the beginning of the breeding season. Our results support the idea that density-mediated COEs are critical for understanding population dynamics in seasonal environments.",,,Density-dependence,,2014-01-28,,1,zenodo,,,,not in the field,no,X,,,NA,NA,NA,drosophila,,,,,,,,,,,,,,experiments

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6q5g3,Data from: Fine-scale assessment of genetic diversity of trembling aspen in northwestern North America,"Background
In North America, the last ice age is the most recent event with severe consequences on boreal species' ranges. Phylogeographic patterns of range expansion in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) suggested that Beringia is likely to be a refugium and the ""ice-free corridor"" in Alberta may represent a region where small populations persisted during the last glacial maximum (LGM). The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether the origins of trembling aspen in western North America are reflected in the patterns of neutral genetic diversity and population structure. A total of 28 sites were sampled covering the northwestern part of aspen's distribution, from Saskatchewan to Alaska. Twelve microsatellite markers were used to describe patterns of genetic diversity. The genetic structure of trembling aspen populations was assessed by using multivariate analyses, Mantel correlograms, neighbor-joining trees and Bayesian analysis.
Results
Microsatellite markers revealed little to no neutral genetic structure of P. tremuloides populations in northwestern North America. Low differentiation among populations and small isolation by distance (IBD) were observed. The most probable number of clusters detected by STRUCTURE was K‚Äâ=‚Äâ3 (‚àÜK‚Äâ=‚Äâ5.9). The individuals in the populations of the 3 clusters share a common gene pool and showed a high level of admixture. No evidence was found that either Beringia or the ""ice-free corridor"" were refugia. Highest allelic richness (AR) and lowest heterozygosity (Ho) were observed in Alberta foothills of the Rocky Mountains.
Conclusions
Contrary to our hypothesis, our results showed that microsatellite markers revealed little to no genetic structure in P. tremuloides populations. Consequently, no divergent populations were observed near supposed refugia. The lack of detectable refugia in Beringia and in the ""ice-free corridor"" was due to high levels of gene flow between trembling apsen populations. More favorable environmental conditions for sexual reproduction and successful trembling aspen seedling establishment may have contributed to increase allelic richness through recombination in populations from the Albertan foothills of the Rocky Mountains.",,,Aspen,,2016-10-28,,3,zenodo,,,,location,no,X,,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Western Canada.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8w9ghx3pf,A mechanistic model of functional response provides new insights into indirect interactions among arctic tundra prey,"Prey handling processes are considered a dominant mechanism leading to short-term positive indirect effects between prey that share a predator. However, a growing body of research indicates that predators  are not necessarily limited by such processes in the wild. Density-dependent changes in predator foraging behavior can also generate positive indirect effects but they are rarely included as explicit functions of prey densities in functional response models. With the aim of untangling proximate mechanisms of species interactions in natural communities and improving our ability to quantify interaction strength, we extended the multi-prey version of the Holling disk equation by including density-dependent changes in predator foraging behavior. Our model, based on species traits and behavior, was inspired by the vertebrate community of the arctic tundra, where the main predator (the arctic fox) is an active forager feeding primarily on cyclic small rodent (lemming) and eggs of various tundra-nesting bird species. Short-term positive indirect effects of lemmings on birds have been documented over the circumpolar Arctic but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We used a unique data set, containing high-frequency GPS tracking, accelerometer, behavioral, and experimental data to parameterize the multi-prey model, and a 15-year time series of prey densities and bird nesting success to evaluate interaction strength between species. We found that: (i) prey handling processes play a minor role in our system and (ii) changes in arctic fox daily activity budget and distance traveled can partly explain the predation release on birds observed during lemming peaks. These adjustments in predator foraging behavior with respect to the main prey density thus appear as the dominant mechanism leading to positive indirect effects commonly reported among arctic tundra prey. Density-dependent changes in functional response components have been little studied in natural vertebrate communities and deserve more attention to improve our ability to quantify the strength of species interactions.","<p>The datasets (fox_daily_activity and LPS_Densities_NestingSuccess) provided here contain raw data used in the models presented in the article ""A mechanistic model of functional response provides new insights into indirect interactions among arctic tundra prey"".

	<li>
<a name=""_Hlk61288143""> Canopy structure is an important driver of the energy budget of the grassland ecosystem and is, at the same time, altered by plant diversity. </a>Diverse plant communities typically have taller and more densely packed canopies than less diverse communities. With this, they absorb more radiation, have a higher transpiring leaf surface, and are better coupled to the atmosphere which leads to cooler canopy surfaces. However, whether plant diversity generally translates into a cooling potential remains unclear and lacks empirical evidence. Here, we assessed how functional identity, functional diversity, and species richness of grassland communities in the Jena Experiment predict the mean and variation of plant surface temperature mediated via effects of canopy structure.</li>
	<li>Using terrestrial laser scanning, we estimated canopy structure describing metrics of vertical structure (mean height, LAI), the distribution (evenness), and the highest allocation (center of gravity) of biomass along height strata. As metrics of horizontal structure, we considered community stands gaps, canopy surface variation, and emergent flowers. We measured surface temperature with a thermal camera. We used SEM models to predict biodiversity effects on the surface temperature during two seasonal peaks of biomass.</li>
	<li>Before the first cut in May, herb-dominated communities directly promoted lower leaf surface temperatures. However, communities with a lower center of gravity (mostly herb-dominated) also increased canopy surface temperatures compared with grass-dominated communities with higher biomass stored in the top canopy. Grass-dominated communities showed a smaller variation of surface temperatures, which was also positively affected by species richness via an increase in mean height. In August, mean surface temperature decreased with increasing community clumpiness and LAI. The variation of surface temperature was greater in herb-dominated than in grass-dominated communities and increased with plant species richness (direct effects).</li>
	<li>Synthesis: The mean and variation of canopy surface temperature were driven by differences in functional group composition (herbs- vs. grass dominance) and to a lesser extent by plant diversity. These effects were partly mediated by the metrics of canopy structure but also by direct effects unrelated to the structural metrics considered. †</li>
</ol>","<p><span><span class=""objectBox objectBox-string"">Our field data was collected within the Trait-Based Biodiversity Experiment in 2014 (TBE; Ebeling et al., 2014) at the Jena Experiment site (Thuringia, Germany; 50∞55¥ N, 11∞35`E, 130 m above sea level (Roscher et al., 2004; Weisser et al., 2017). We conducted this study in 92 plots of the Trait-Based experiment (3.5 m x 3.5 m size), comprehending the two species pools, with a gradient of plant species richness of 1 to 8 species. We performed a non-destructive measurement of plant community canopy structure at high resolution, we used a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) Faro Focus 3D X330 (FARO Technologies Inc., 2011). We scanned 92 plots on April 31st (the first peak of biomass) and August 20th, 2014 (the second biomass peak). The TLS was mounted upside-down on a tripod that was elevated 3.35 m above ground level. The legs of the tripod were centered on permanent survey markers to guarantee identical scanning areas on both dates. We extracted an area of 3.75 m≤ (1.5 m x 2.5 m) in each plot below the scanner to reduce the effect of shadows within scans. The point clouds of the 92 plots were filtered using statistical outlier removal (SOR) and noise filter. We used the 3D point clouds from terrestrial laser scanning to calculate metrics characterizing vertical and horizontal dimensions of the community canopy structure. We produced height-based metrics from the point cloud of each community. We used mean height as the first vertical dimension metric. To characterize vertical space-filling properties, we calculated the evenness and the center of gravity of the point cloud. Evenness reports the homogeneity of the point cloud density in their vertical distribution, while the center of gravity identifies the height stratum (definition see below) with the highest density of points (Spehn et al., 2000; Barry et al., 2020). As a baseline for only these two vertical metrics (evenness and center of gravity), we calculated voxel grids from the 3D point cloud for each plot. For each scan, a voxel grid of 5 cm was created containing at least one laser return, and the volume was then calculated as the product of the cell area and the attributed height. We used the function 'vox' from the R package VoxR (Lecigne et al., 2014). We used the voxel grids to define five different strata of height (0.3 - 20 cm, 20 - 40 cm, 40 - 60 cm, 60 ñ 80 cm, and 80 - 100 cm). For every stratum, we applied the method 'Sum of Voxel,' which calculated the sum of all voxels separately for each of the five strata. As a result, we obtained volumetric data based on 3D point clouds for five different strata and the community canopy height. Based on this information, the evenness metric represents the mean proportion of filled voxels across strata of vegetation height, calculated as the sum of all five voxel strata volumes divided by 5. The center of gravity, in turn, used the volume of voxel grids per height strata to identify the location with the highest density of points. This location was measured in terms of the height-weighted average volume allocation of the community. We then calculated the center of gravity by multiplying each stratum's volume with the mean height of the strata and dividing by the total community volume. Center of gravity range from 1 to 5, in which 1 is the bottom layer (0-20 cm) and five the top canopy (80-100 cm). Further, the leaf area index was also measured at the same time in all 92 plots using the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer (LI-Cor, Inc, 2013). Ten random measurements were averaged to a mean of LAI value per plot. Hence, we used LAI as an additional vertical dimensional metric to characterize plant ground area covered by the plant community. To assess the horizontal heterogeneity of the plant community for each plot, we also calculated two horizontal metrics describing the canopy surface variation and clumpiness. We used the surface reconstruction method, which fits a mesh on the 3D point cloud density of each plot (the filtered point clouds and not voxel grids) (Attene &amp; Spagnuolo, 2000). We applied the Poisson Surface Reconstruction method, which fits a mesh on all oriented points (perpendicular vectors to the tangential plane to the surface at that point) (Kazhdan &amp; Hoppe, 2019). After producing the surface mesh for all plots, a surface area of the mesh in square meters was calculated and divided by the area of the plot (3.75 m≤). The variation metric is a dimensionless ratio between the mesh surface area and the ground area. For clumpiness, we evaluated the size and distribution of clusters in the spatial arrangement of the point cloud into two dimensions based on the rasterized 3D point clouds. For this, we computed Geary¥s index, an identifier of cluster points with similar attributes, assessed by the pixel spatial autocorrelation. We used the function Geary from the R package ""raster"". The two response variables, the mean and the coefficient of variation (hereafter CV) of community surface temperature were obtained using the Testo 882 Thermal Imaging Camera, which also recorded RGB images of all 92 plots (for example, Figure 3). We obtained the thermal data and terrestrial laser scans within two days. All thermal measurements were carried out around noon (12:30 ñ 13:30), at 150 cm height, and facing north. The thermal camera settings controlled the canopy's emissivity as 0.95 with reflectance temperature at 20∞C. The sensor detects long-wave infrared radiation in the spectral range from 7.5 to 14 ?m and has a thermal sensitivity of 50 mK at +30∞C and accuracy of ±2.0∞C. With the thermal matrix (registered pixel temperature with an original resolution of 640 x 480), we computed the mean and the coefficient of variation of surface temperature for each plot. As flower heads are often 10 K warmer than the surrounding leaves of herbs and grasses, we calculated the Normalized Green-Red Difference Index (NGRDI, the difference between the green and red bands divided by their sum (PÈrez et al., 2000). Further, we also calculated the Normalized Green-Blue Difference Index (NGBDI, the difference between the green and the blue bands divided by their sum (Wang Xiaoqin et al., 2015) better to distinguish the hot spots of inflorescences and green vegetation. We expected that biodiversity effects on mean canopy surface temperature are indirectly mediated by predictors related to vertical structure metrics, while biodiversity effects on temperature CV are mediated by the horizontal structure. To test these assumptions further, we constructed a more detailed formal hypothesis using linear mixed-effects models within a PiecewiseSEM (Lefcheck, 2016). we ran the initial SEM model as a list of causal relationships between canopy structure and biodiversity facets. The last linear model inside the SEM was between the mean and CV of surface temperature and biodiversity facets (functional identity, dispersion, and species richness) and all canopy structure metrics to test the fit of the model to the data. Second, we inspected this initial SEM model results for goodness-of-fit tests for both the full and causal relationships, we then added the predictors that significantly improved the model fit with P values higher than 0.05.</span></span></p>","<p>There are no missing values.

<p>Vascular plant species cover data at each site. One 400 m2 circular plot was randomly positioned in each of the 33 selected stands. In each circular plot, 20 quadrats (1 m2) were arranged in a cross shape pointing at the four cardinal directions with five quadrats on each branch. A survey of the vascular understory vegetation was carried out inside each quadrat by identifying all herbaceous and woody species and defining their percent cover based on vertical projections. Percentages were visually assessed by two independent observers and rare species (&lt;1% cover) were assigned a cover of 0.5%. For each site, plant covers were summed up by species using the 20 quadrats (covers ranged from 0-2000).†</p>

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vt4b8gtnv,Copy number variants outperform SNPs to reveal genotype-temperature association in a marine species,"<p>Copy number variants (CNVs) are a major component of genotypic and phenotypic variation in genomes. To date, our knowledge of genotypic variation and evolution has largely been acquired by means of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) analyses. Until recently, the adaptive role of structural variants (SVs) and particularly that of CNVs has been overlooked in wild populations, partly due to their challenging identification. Here, we document the usefulness of Rapture, a derived reduced?representation shotgun sequencing approach, to detect and investigate copy number variants (CNVs) alongside SNPs in American lobster (<i>Homarus americanus</i>) populations. We conducted a comparative study to examine the potential role of SNPs and CNVs in local adaptation by sequencing 1,141 lobsters from 21 sampling sites within the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, which experiences the highest yearly thermal variance of the Canadian marine coastal waters. Our results demonstrated that CNVs account for higher genetic differentiation than SNP markers. Contrary to SNPs, for which no significant geneticñenvironment association was found, 48 CNV candidates were significantly associated with the annual variance of sea surface temperature, leading to the genetic clustering of sampling locations despite their geographic separation. Altogether, we provide a strong empirical case that CNVs putatively contribute to local adaptation in marine species and unveil stronger spatial signal of population structure than SNPs. Our study provides the means to study CNVs in nonmodel species and highlights the importance of considering structural variants alongside SNPs to enhance our understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes shaping adaptive population structure.</p>","<p align=""justify"" class=""western"" style=""text-align:left;""><span style=""background:transparent none 0% 0%;""><font color=""#000000""><font>A total of 1,141 lobster samples were collected from 21 sites between May and July in 2016 in the southern area of the Gulf of St-Lawrence.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xgxd254dk,Data for: Parasitoids indicate major climate-induced shifts in Arctic communities,"<p>Climatic impacts are especially pronounced in the Arctic, which as a region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe. Here, we investigate how mean climatic conditions and rates of climatic change impact parasitoid insect communities in 16 localities across the Arctic. We focus on parasitoids in a wide-spread habitat, <em>Dryas</em> heathlands, and describe parasitoid community composition in terms of larval host use (i.e. parasitoid use of herbivorous Lepidoptera versus pollinating Diptera) and functional groups (i.e. parasitoids adhering to an idiobiont versus koinobiont lifestyle). Of the latter, we expect idiobionts to be generally associated with poorer tolerance to cold temperatures. To further test our findings, we assess whether similar climatic variables are associated with host abundances in a 22-year time series from Northeast Greenland. We find that sites which have experienced a temperature rise in summer while retaining cold winters to be dominated by parasitoids of Lepidoptera, with the pattern reversed among the parasitoids of Diptera. The rate of summer temperature rise is further associated with higher levels of herbivory, suggesting higher availability of lepidopteran hosts and changes in ecosystem functioning. We also detect a matching signal over time, as higher summer temperatures, coupled with cold early winter soils, are related to high herbivory by lepidopteran larvae, and to declines in the abundance of dipteran pollinators. Collectively, our results suggest that in parts of the warming Arctic, <em>Dryas</em> is being simultaneously exposed to increased herbivory and reduced pollination. Our findings point to potential drastic and rapid consequences of climate change on multitrophic-level community structure and on ecosystem functioning and highlight the value of collaborative systematic sampling effort.</p>","<p>1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:†</p>

<p>This dataset comprises of parasitoids caught in 2016 at 19 Arctic and Sub-Arctic localities during two consecutive six-day-long trapping periods aimed to take place during the flowering peak of the mountain avens (Dryas spp.). †Each location had three to four trapping sites (A-D) in Dryas heath type habitats, each with ten 5cm by 4.5cm white sticky traps cut out from sticky board (Barrettine Environmental, UK [product no longer available]). Sticky traps were embedded in growths of Dryas spp.</p>

<p>The parasitoids were subsequently picked of off the sticky traps, their whole DNA was extracted and half of their Cytochrome Oxidase I barcode region was amplified using Primers B-F and HCO. The processing of samples was done in three parts (Data1, Data2, Data2) with slightly different methodology. See the supplementary information of the recommended publication for more details. Datasets were sequenced at the Helsinki Functional Genomics Unit (FuGU) in two separate MiSeq v3 2x300bp runs (Data1 and Data2). Additionally, a set of samples from a specific site (Zackenberg) were sequenced as part of larger set at the FIMM Technology Centre in a HiSeq2500 2x250bp run (Data3).</p>

<p>Additionally, Dryas flower count, flowering phenology and flower damage by insect herbivores was recorded at the start, after a week (day 6) and in the end (day 12). These counts were done in 3 to 5 1/4 square meter monitoring plots per trapping site. Microclimate was recorded at one trapping site per locality using Lascar EL-USB-2 tempeerature and air humidity loggers under a small white plastic dome at ~ 10 cm height.</p>

<p>2. Methods for processing the data:†</p>

<p>Initially, paired-end reads were merged and trimmed for quality using 32-bit usearch version 11 (Edgar 2010) with the command 'fastq_mergepairs'. Primers were removed using software cutadapt version 1.14 (Martin 2011) with 15% mismatch rate. The reads were then collapsed into unique sequences (singletons removed) with command 'fastx_uniques'. The subsequent clustering steps differed slightly for different data sets, due to the origin of the data (MiSeq vs. HiSeq2500), as follows. For Data1 and Data2, the newly-collapsed unique sequences were cleaned of chimeras using command 'uchime_denovo' and clustered into 96% OTUs (OTU = Operational Taxonomical Unit) using command 'cluster_size' using USEARCH. The choice of 96% clustering threshold was based on empirical optimization, considering both the rapid genetic divergence in CO1, as well as potential sequencing errors. For Data3, the unique sequences were denoised (i.e., chimeras were removed) and reads were clustered into ZOTUs (= 'zero-radius OTU') with command 'unoise3' using USEARCH version 11. These ZOTUs do not practically differ from traditional clustering of OTUs (which are based on pre-set percentage threshold), but according to Edgar and Flyvbjerg (2015), the UNOISE algorithm performs better for certain heterogenous data sets in (i) removing chimeras, (ii) PhiX sequences and (iii) Illumina artefacts. Then OTUs and ZOTUs were mapped back to the original trimmed reads with command 'usearch_global' ('search_exact' for Data3) to establish the total number of reads in each sample using 64-bit software vsearch (Rognes et al. 2016). Overall, we were able to map 25,673,920 reads (Data1: 4,261,291; Data2: 12,095,141; Data3: 9,317,488) to our original samples. These reads were subject to further filtering: from each sample, each OTU/ZOTU with less reads than 2% of the total reads in that sample were discarded, which also cleared most of the extraction and PCR negative controls. Finally, samples producing less than 37 reads (a threshold chosen by analysing the data as a whole) were removed from the subsequent analysis.</p>

<p>The taxonomic assignations were initially done independently for each dataset (using identical criteria), but the final assignations were carried out using the whole, combined (Data1+Data2+Data3) dataset. The OTUs/ZOTUs were initially identified into genus-level using the RDP classifier with a very recently constructed COI-RDP database v3.2 (with 60% probability threshold for genus-level assignation) following Porter and Hajibabaei (2018). In cases where the database was clearly insufficient to reach a genus-level assignation, we used local BLAST against all the retrieved COI sequences in BOLD (Altschul et al. 1990; Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007) and chose the most probable match. Taxonomic information for remaining hits was retrieved manually from BOLD using BIN code (from earlier steps) or the actual OTU/ZOTU sequence. Finally, identifications were checked against our preliminary identification notes taken at the beginning of DNA extraction, and potentially false assignations (due to for example contamination in certain steps, or clear errors in the database) were either removed or assigned to the likely correct out/ZOTU.</p>

<p>As the end result of all the bioinformatic steps, we arrived at a list of 460 parasitoid taxa (listed in OTU_info.csv Those dataset specific OTUs which were collapsed to one in the merging of the datasets are also listed in this file).</p>","<p>The included README_PanArcticParasitods.txt file contains detailed metadata on all included variables.</p>

<p>There are some missing data e.g.:</p>

<p>In the†in situ microclimate measurements misising values are denoted with,†NA</p>

<p>In the parasitoid data, samples which failed to to produce parasitoid reads are marked with NA.</p>

<p>In the Dryas data, two localities have their data†data†missing, and are not included in this table, where as one site Kobbejford had no <em>Dryas</em> and has counts of Loiseleuria procumbens as a phenological indicator in stead.†This is marked in the datapoint notes.</p>

<p>Concerning OTUs:†Our OTUs are based on only a half of the CO1 barcode region and we used a quite wide clustering treshold of 96%. Also the clustering was done globally on a dataset containing closely related species from different continents. While this works well for the intended purpose of looking at functional group dominance at site level, the taxonomic resolution is inadequate for applications requiring true species level information. In such occasiton we encourage contacting the corresponding author. The DNA extracts are stored at†the Department of Agricultural Sciences of the University of Helsinki, Finland.</p>

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8mc79,Data from: A new method for studying population genetics of cyst nematodes based on Pool-Seq and genome-wide allele frequency analysis,"Cyst nematodes are important agricultural pests responsible for billions of dollars of losses each year. Plant resistance is the most effective management tool, but it requires a close monitoring of population genetics. Current technologies for pathotyping and genotyping cyst nematodes are time-consuming, expensive and imprecise. In this study, we capitalized on the reproduction mode of cyst nematodes to develop a simple population genetic analysis pipeline based on genotyping-by-sequencing and Pool-Seq. This method yielded thousands of SNPs and allowed us to study the relationships between populations of different origins or pathotypes. Validation of the method on well-characterized populations also demonstrated that it was a powerful and accurate tool for population genetics. The genomewide allele frequencies of 23 populations of golden nematode, from nine countries and representing the five known pathotypes, were compared. A clear separation of the pathotypes and fine genetic relationships between and among global populations were obtained using this method. In addition to being powerful, this tool has proven to be very time- and cost-efficient and could be applied to other cyst nematode species.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Sample description<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Details about the origin (Country, province and field) of the samples, which experiment and figures they were used in and accession numbers (bioproject and biosample numbers).</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Detail on samples.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Supplemental Table 1<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Population differentiation (Fst) of 23 worldwide populations of Globodera rostochiensis estimated from genome-wide allele frequencies at 604 loci.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Suppl Table1.docx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Custom scripts and softwares<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">A link where all the custom scripts and softwares used in this paper can be found.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">scripts.txt<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">PstI-MspI SNP table - UNEAK - 23 worldwide populations<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Generated with mnC=0.8, minCov=1  and a MAF=0.01.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.c3s62,Data from: An integrated approach to historical population assessment of the great whales: case of the New Zealand southern right whale,"Accurate estimation of historical abundance provides an essential baseline for judging the recovery of the great whales. This is particularly challenging for whales hunted prior to twentieth century modern whaling, as population-level catch records are often incomplete. Assessments of whale recovery using pre-modern exploitation indices are therefore rare, despite the intensive, global nature of nineteenth century whaling. Right whales (Eubalaena spp.) were particularly exploited: slow swimmers with strong fidelity to sheltered calving bays, the species made predictable and easy targets. Here, we present the first integrated population-level assessment of the whaling impact and pre-exploitation abundance of a right whale, the New Zealand southern right whale (E. australis). In this assessment, we use a Bayesian population dynamics model integrating multiple data sources: nineteenth century catches, genetic constraints on bottleneck size and individual sightings histories informing abundance and trend. Different catch allocation scenarios are explored to account for uncertainty in the population's offshore distribution. From a pre-exploitation abundance of 28?800ñ47?100 whales, nineteenth century hunting reduced the population to approximately 30ñ40 mature females between 1914 and 1926. Today, it stands at less than 12% of pre-exploitation abundance. Despite the challenges of reconstructing historical catches and population boundaries, conservation efforts of historically exploited species benefit from targets for ecological restoration.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Southern right whale population model<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This is the R script used to conduct the population assessments.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.b2rbnzsbc,Data from: Colour pattern variation forms local background matching camouflage in a leaf-mimicking toad,"<p>Optimal camouflage can, in principle, be relatively easily achieved in simple, homogeneous, environments where backgrounds always have the same color, brightness, and patterning. Natural environments are, however, rarely homogenous and species often find themselves viewed against varied backgrounds where the task of concealment is more challenging. One result of variable backgrounds is the evolution of intraspecific phenotypic variation which may either be†generalized, with multiple similarly cryptic patterns, or†specialized, with each discrete color form maximizing concealment against a single component of the background. We investigated the role of phenotypic variation in a highly variable population of the Neotropical toad†<em>Rhinella margaritifera</em>†using visual modeling and a computer-based detection task. We found that phenotypic variation was not divided into discrete color morphs and all toads were well camouflaged against the forest floor. However, although the whole population may appear to consist of random samples from the background, the toads were a particularly close match to the leaf litter, suggesting that they masquerade as dead leaves, which are themselves variable. Furthermore, rather than each color form being equally effective against a single background, each toad was specialized towards its own particular local surroundings, as suggested by a specialist strategy. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of background matching to a nominally masquerading species, as well as how habitat heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales may affect the evolution of camouflage and phenotypic variation.</p>",,<p>Funding provided by: University of Bristol<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000883<br>Award Number: Postgraduate scholarship</p><p>Funding provided by: Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794<br>Award Number: ANR-10-LABX-25-01</p><p>Funding provided by: Le Fonds de recherche du QuÈbec ñ Nature et Technologies postdoctoral fellowship*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: PBEEEñV2: 263478</p>,,,2021-09-14,,6,zenodo,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"South America.

Some of the expected changes result from processes whose effects will be difficult to alter, such as global climate change. We present a novel framework in which we use models to (1) identify the ecological changes from these difficult-to-alter processes, as well as (2) the potential conservation measures that are best able to compensate for these changes. We illustrated this framework with the case of an endangered caribou population in QuÈbec, Canada. We coupled a spatially explicit individual-based movement model with a range of landscape scenarios to assess the impacts of varying degrees of climate change, and the ability of conservation actions to compensate for such impacts on caribou movement behaviors. We found that (1) climate change impacts reduced movement potential, and that (2) the complete restoration of secondary roads inside protected areas was able to fully offset this reduction, suggesting that road restoration would be an effective compensatory conservation action. By evaluating conservation actions via landscape use simulated by an individual-based model, we were able to identify compensatory conservation options for an endangered species facing climate change.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Habitat Quality Maps for caribou movement models<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Archive of 24 tifs of seasonal (winter&amp;summef) habitat quality maps for 12 management/climate change scenarios, as detailed in the manuscript and supplementary material.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">rasterMapsScenarios.rar<br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",Anthropocene; movement potential; Rangifer tarandus caribou; road restoration; Caribou,Canada; GaspÈsie; QuÈbec,2018-11-21,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-34822-9,6,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,M,repository,.tif,distribution model,no,"Map, administrative unit",caribou,no,NA,no,NA,25000,source publication text,distribution,,,,Scientific Reports,,,Simulations of species' movement potential

We investigated how woodland caribou, a threatened species inhabiting North-American boreal forests, modified their fine-scale movements when confronted with forest management features (i.e. clearcuts and roads). We used GPS telemetry data collected between 2004 and 2010 on 49 female caribou in a managed area in QuÈbec, Canada. Movements were studied using a use ñ availability design contrasting observed steps (i.e. line connecting two consecutive locations) with random steps (i.e. proxy of immediate habitat availability). Although caribou mostly avoided disturbances, individuals nonetheless modulated their fine-scale response to disturbances on a daily and annual basis, potentially compromising between risk avoidance in periods of higher vulnerability (i.e. calving, early and late winter) during the day and foraging activities in periods of higher energy requirements (i.e. spring, summer and rut) during dusk/dawn and at night. The local context in which females moved was shown to influence their decision to cross clearcut edges and roads. Indeed, although females typically avoided crossing clearcut edges and roads at low densities, crossing rates were found to rapidly increase in greater disturbance densities. In some instance, however, females were less likely to cross edges and roads as densities increased. Females may then be trapped and forced to use disturbed habitats, known to be associated with higher predation risk. We believe that further increases in anthropogenic disturbances could exacerbate such behavioural responses and ultimately lead to population level consequences.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Beauchesne Jaeger and St-Laurent_PLoS ONE datasets<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Characteristics of observed and random steps of female Woodland caribou inhabiting a highly disturbed landscape in eastern Canada.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Beauchesne et al_datasets PLoS ONE.zip<br></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",Cumulative effects; Woodland caribou; Forestry and roads; Rangifer tarandus caribou; current; Anthropogenic disturbances; Step-selection functions,Eastern Canada,2013-11-12,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0077514,6,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.txt,no,no,site coordinates,caribou,2004-2010,source publication text,6,NA,31000,source publication text,other,,,,Plos One,,,data are only landscape and individual's movement features. 
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.914j5m0,Data from: Facilitation of balsam fir by trembling aspen in the boreal forest: do ectomycorrhizal communities matter?,"Succession is generally well described above-ground in the boreal forest, and several studies have demonstrated the role of interspecific facilitation in tree species establishment. However the role of mycorrhizal communities for tree establishment and interspecific facilitation, has been little explored. At the ecotone between the mixed boreal forest, dominated by balsam fir and hardwood species, and the boreal forest, dominated by black spruce, several stands of trembling aspen can be found, surrounded by black spruce forest. Regeneration of balsam fir seems to have increased in the recent decades within the boreal forest, and it seems better adapted to grow in trembling aspen stands than in black spruce stands, even when located in similar abiotic conditions. As black spruce stands are also covered by ericaceous shrubs, we investigated if differences in soil fungal communities and ericaceous shrubs abundance could explain the differences observed in balsam fir growth and nutrition. We conducted a study centered on individual saplings to link growth and foliar nutrient concentrations to local vegetation cover, mycorrhization rate and mycorrhizal communities associated with balsam fir roots. We found that foliar nutrient concentrations and ramification indices (colonization by mycorrhiza per length of root) were greater in trembling aspen stands and were positively correlated to apical and lateral growth of balsam fir saplings. In black spruce stands, the presence of ericaceous shrubs near balsam fir saplings affected ectomycorrhizal communities associated with tree roots which in turn negatively correlated with N foliar concentrations. Our results reveal that fungal communities observed under aspen are drivers of balsam fir early growth and nutrition in boreal forest stands and may facilitate ecotone migration in a context of climate change.",#N/A,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">speciesbysamplematrix<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">ECM matrix</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">speciesbysamplematric.csv<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">BF_measures<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Environmental variables measured around each balsam fir sapling</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">needlesnutrientanalyses<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Nutrients measured in needles from balsam fir saplings</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">seqECM<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">DNA sequences from ectomycorrhizal root tips sampled on balsam fir saplings</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",Ectomycorrhiza; ericaceous shrubs; Abies balsamea; Picea mariana,Canada; Abitibi-TÈmiscamingue and Nord du QuÈbec region; QuÈbec,2019-07-30,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.00932,4,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.csv,site IDs,no,site coordinates,black spruce,2015-2016,"source link abstract, source publication text",no,NA,36,source publication text,presence only,,,,Frontiers in Plant Science,,,Site codes in the dataset.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t11f5,Data from: Habitat-based polymorphism is common in stream fishes,"1. Morphological differences (size and shape) across habitats are common in lake fish where differences relate to two dominant contrasting habitats: the pelagic and littoral habitat. Repeated occurrence of littoral and pelagic morphs across multiple populations of several lake fish species has been considered as important evidence that polymorphism is adaptive in these systems. It has been suggested that these habitat-based polymorphic differences are due to the temporal stability of the differences between littoral and pelagic habitats. 2. Although streams are spatially heterogeneous, they are also more temporally dynamic than lakes and it is still an open question whether streams provide the environmental conditions that promote habitat-based polymorphism. We tested whether fish from riffle, run and pool habitats, respectively, differed consistently in their morphology. 3. Our test compared patterns of morphological variation (size and shape) in 10 fish species from the three stream habitat types in 36 separate streams distributed across three watersheds. 4. For most species, body size and shape (after controlling for body size) differed across riffle, run and pool habitats. Unlike many lake species, the nature of these differences was not consistent across species, possibly because these species use these habitat types in different ways. 5. Our results suggest that habitat-based polymorphism is an important feature also in stream-fishes despite the fact that streams are temporally variable in contrast to lake systems. Future research is required to assess whether the patterns of habitat-polymorphism encountered in streams have a genetic basis or they are simply the result of within generation phenotypic plasticity.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">DataSenayetal2014<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">In this file you will find partial warps and fish length for the 10 species studied.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m233m,Data from: Herbivory and pollen limitation at the upper elevational range limit of two forest understory plants of eastern North America,"Studies of species' range limits focus most often on abiotic factors, although the strength of biotic interactions might also vary along environmental gradients and have strong demographic effects. For example, pollinator abundance might decrease at range limits due to harsh environmental conditions, and reduced plant density can reduce attractiveness to pollinators and increase or decrease herbivory. We tested for variation in the strength of pollen limitation and herbivory by ungulates along a gradient leading to the upper elevational range limits of Trillium erectum (Melanthiaceae) and Erythronium americanum (Liliaceae) in Mont-MÈgantic National Park, QuÈbec, Canada. In T. erectum, pollen limitation was higher at the range limit, but seed set decreased only slightly with elevation and only in one of two years. In contrast, herbivory of T. erectum increased from &lt;10% at low elevations to &gt;60% at the upper elevational range limit. In E. americanum, we found no evidence of pollen limitation despite a significant decrease in seed set with elevation, and herbivory was low across the entire gradient. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential for relatively strong negative interactions (herbivory) and weak positive interactions (pollination) at plant range edges, although this was clearly species-specific. To the extent that these interactions have important demographic consequences ñ highly likely for herbivory on Trillium, based on previous studies ñ such interactions might play a role in determining plant species' range limits along putatively climatic gradients.",#N/A,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Trillium_erectum_Pollen_Limitation_2016<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Reproductive success and leaf size of Trillium erectum for control and pollen supplemented individuals along an elevation gradient at Mont-MÈgantic National Park.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">trillium_erectum_PL_2016.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Erythronium_americanum_Pollen_Limiation_2016<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Reproductive success and leaf size of Erythronium americanum for control and pollen supplemented individuals along an elevation gradient at Mont-MÈgantic National Park.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">erythronium_americanum_PL_2016.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Trillium_erectum_herbivory_2016<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Proportion of browsed Trillium erectum individuals along an elevation gradient at Mont-MÈgantic National Park.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">trillium_erectum_herbivorie_2016.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Erythronium_americanum_herbivory_2016<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Proportion of browsed Erythronium americanum individuals along an elevation gradient at Mont-MÈgantic National Park.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">erythronium_americanum_herbivorie_2016.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Number_of_seeds_T.erectum_E.americanum_2015_2016<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Reproductive success of Trillium erectum and Erythronium americanum along an elevation gradient at Mont-MÈgantic National Park.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">nombre_de_graines_contrÙles_T.erectum_E.americanum_2015_2016.xlsx<br></div></div>",range limit; Trillium erectum; Erythronium americanum; reproductive success; pollen limitation,Mont-MÈgantic National Park,2018-08-10,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3397,4,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.xlsx,no,administrative unit,site coordinates,"Trillium erectum, Erythronium americanum",2015-2016,source publication text,1,NA,55,source publication text,presence only,,,,Ecology and Evolution,,,Geospatial information is Mont Megantic
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1cc4v,Data from: Impacts of human disturbance on large prey species: do behavioral reactions translate to fitness consequences?,"Anthropogenic disturbances have been demonstrated to affect animal behavior, distribution, and abundance, but assessment of their impacts on fitness-related traits has received little attention. We hypothesized that human activities and infrastructure cause a decrease in the individual performance of preys because of anthropogenically enhanced predation risk. We evaluated the impacts of commercial logging and road networks on the fitness of a large herbivore known to be sensitive to human disturbance: the forest-dwelling woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). For 8 consecutive years (2004ñ2011) we monitored 59 individuals using GPS telemetry in the Charlevoix region of QuÈbec, Canada. We also used Very High Frequency telemetry locations collected on 28 individuals from 1999ñ2000. We related habitat selection of adult caribou at various spatio-temporal scales to their probability of dying from predation, and to indices of their reproductive success and energy expenditure. The probability that adult caribou died from predation increased with the proportion of recent disturbances (including cutblocks ?5 years old) in their annual home range. The respective effects of increasing paved and forestry road densities depended upon the overall road density within the home range of caribou. At a finer scale of 10 to 15 days before their death, caribou that were killed by a predator selected for recent disturbances more than individuals that survived, and avoided old mature conifer stands. The home range area of caribou increased with road density. Finally, the composition of the home range of females had no effect on their reproductive success. We show that human activities and infrastructure may influence the individual performance of large prey species in highly managed regions.

Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall) reaches its northern continuous distributional limit in north-eastern North America at the transition between boreal mixed-wood and temperate deciduous forests. We hypothesized that marginal fragmented northern populations from the boreal mixed-wood would have a distinct pattern of genetic structure and diversity. We analyzed 18 microsatellite loci variation in 23 populations distributed along three latitudinal transects (west, central and east) that encompass the continuous-discontinuous species range. Each transect was divided into two zones, continuous (temperate deciduous) and discontinuous (boreal mixed-wood), based on sugar maple stand abundance. Respective positive and negative relationships were found between the distance of each population to the northern limit (D north), and allelic richness (AR) and population differentiation (FST). These relations were tested for each transect separately; the pattern (discontinuous/continuous) remained significant only for the western transect. structure analysis revealed the presence of four clusters. The most northern populations of each transect were assigned to a distinct group. Asymmetrical gene flow occurred from the southern into the four northernmost populations. Southern populations in QuÈbec may have originated from two different postglacial migration routes.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2v6wwpzqx,Data from: Irregular forest structures originating after fire: an opportunity to promote alternatives to even-aged management in boreal forests,"<p><span>1. Even-aged silviculture based on short-rotation clearcuts had severely altered boreal forests. Silvicultural alternatives (e.g., continuous cover or retention forestry) has the potential to restore and protect the habitats and functions of boreal forests. These alternatives are however often restricted to structurally complex old-growth forest, which are particularly threatened by anthropogenic disturbances. Increasing the use of alternatives to even-aged silviculture in early-successional stands could help recruit more structurally complex forests, with characteristics closer to the old-growth. In this article, we therefore evaluate the potential for silvicultural alternatives to even-aged management in boreal forests that burned less than a century ago.</span></p>
<p><span>2. We analyzed 1085 field plots in a 243000 km<sup>2</sup> area situated in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. These plots burned 30 to 100 years before the survey and had not been subjected to previous or subsequent anthropogenic disturbance; they hence represent young primary forests. The main patterns of tree diameter distribution variation within the plots were identified using k-means clustering. Stand structure, tree species composition, and environmental variables that most explained the differences among the clusters were identified with a random forest model, and then compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher's exact tests.</span></p>
<p><span>3.</span> <span>The majority (&gt;75 %) of the plots presented an irregular structure of stem diameters (i.e., non-normally distributed, with many small diameter trees). The understorey was generally dominated by black spruce (<em>Picea mariana</em> [Mill.] BSP), a shade-tolerant species. Irregular structures were observed in both forests of high and low productivity, implying that different processes (e.g., early regeneration, variable tree growth) can lead to observed early irregular structure. Regular structures were generally characterized by a higher productivity and abundance in hardwood species compared to the irregular structures. </span></p>
<p><span>4. <em>Synthesis and application</em>: Many boreal forests of eastern Canada progress towards an irregular structure in the decades following the last stand-replacing fire. A substantial part of these early-successional forests may be suitable for alternatives to even-aged silviculture that better maintains habitats and functions of preindustrial boreal forests. </span></p>",,,diameter distribution; forest structure; forest succession; Ecosystem-based Management; Ecological restoration; old-growth forest; Clearcuts; wildfire; Continuous-cover forestry; Close-to-nature silviculture,,2022-04-27,,0,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,H,repository,.csv,sample coordinates,no,NA,black spruce: Picea mariana; jack pine: Pinus banksiana; Balsam fir: Abies balsamea; broadleaved: Betula papyrifera and Populus tremuloides,1973-2016,source publication text,43,NA,243000,source link abstract,density,,,,Journal of Applied Ecology,,,NO LINK TO SOURCE PUBLICATION.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.h65f4,Data from: Logging-induced changes in habitat network connectivity shape behavioral interactions in the wolf-caribou-moose system,"Habitat connectivity influences the distribution dynamics of animals. Connectivity can therefore shape trophic interactions, but little empirical evidence is available, especially for large mammals. In forest ecosystems, logging alters functional connectivity among habitat patches, and such activities can affect the spatial game between large herbivores and their predators. We used graph theory to evaluate how harvesting-induced changes in habitat connectivity influence patch choice and residency time of GPS-collared caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) and moose (Alces alces) in winter in the boreal forest. We then investigated the predatorñprey game by assessing how GPS-collared wolves (Canis lupus) adjusted their movements to changes in landscape properties and in the networks of their prey species. We built prey habitat networks using minimum planar graphs organized around species-specific, highly selected habitat patches (i.e., network nodes). We found that spatial dynamics of large herbivores were influenced not only by the intrinsic quality of habitat patches, but also by the connectivity of those network nodes. Caribou and moose selected nodes that were connected by a high number of links, and moose also spent relatively more time in those nodes. By limiting node accessibility, human disturbances influenced travel decisions. Caribou and moose avoided nodes that were surrounded by a high proportion of cuts and roads, but once within these nodes, moose stayed longer than in other nodes. Caribou selectively moved among nodes with low distance costs, and their residency time increased with distance costs required to reach the nodes. Wolves selected their prey's nodes, where vegetation consumed by caribou and moose was highly abundant. Furthermore, wolves discriminated among those nodes by selecting the most connected ones. In fact, selection by wolves was stronger for their prey's nodes than for the prey's utilization distribution per se, a difference that increased with the level of human disturbance. Considering the difficulty of keeping track of highly mobile prey, predators may benefit by targeting not only their prey's resource patches, but also the most highly connected patches. Matrix quality and connectivity are therefore key elements shaping the predatorñprey spatial game in human-altered landscapes because of their impact on the spatial dynamics of the interacting species.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data for compositional analysis of caribou<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used to characterize the land cover type of node of network for caribou.

Very little is known about the larval biology of most species, however, in part because species identification has historically been hindered by the microscopic size and morphological similarity among related taxa. This study aimed to determine the taxonomic composition and seasonal distribution of meroplankton in the Barents Sea, across the Polar Front. We collected meroplankton during five time points seasonally and used high-throughput DNA barcoding of individual larvae to obtain species-level information on larval seasonality. We found that meroplankton was highly diverse (72 taxa from eight phyla) and present in the Barents Sea year-round with a peak in abundance in August and November, defying the conventional wisdom that peak abundance would coincide with the spring phytoplankton bloom. Ophiuroids, bivalves and polychaetes dominated larval abundance while gastropods and polychaetes accounted for the bulk of the taxon diversity. Community structure varied seasonally and total abundance was generally higher south of the Polar Front while taxon richness was overall greater to the north. Of the species identified, most were known inhabitants of the Barents Sea. However, the nemertean <i>Cephalothrix iwatai</i> and the brittle star <i>Ophiocten gracilis</i> were abundant in the meroplankton despite never having been previously recorded in the northern Barents Sea.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.87jb3,Data from: Multidimensional environmental influences on timing of breeding in a tree swallow population facing climate change,"Most phenological traits are extremely sensitive to current climate change and advances in the timing of important life-history events have been observed in many species. In birds, phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature is thought to be the main mechanism underlying yearly adjustment in the timing of breeding. However, other factors could be important and interact to affect the levels of plastic responses between and/or within-individuals. Here we use long-term individual-based data on Tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) to identify the spatial and environmental drivers affecting plasticity in laying date and to assess their importance at both population and individual levels. We found that laying date has advanced by 4.2 days over 10 years, and that it was mainly influenced by latitude and an interaction between spring temperature and breeder density. Analyses of individual plasticity showed that increases in temperature, but not in breeder density, resulted in within-individual advances in laying date. Our results suggest that females can adjust their laying date as a function of temperature, but that this adjustment will be partly constrained in habitats with lower breeder densities. Such potential constraint is especially worrying for the broad array of species already declining as a result of climate change.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data: determinants of laying date at the population level<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used for the analysis of the determinants of laying date at the population level, where each line represented a farm within a year.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.24q6q70,"Data from: Natal habitat preference induction in large mammals ñ Like mother, like child?","Habitat selection has received considerable attention from ecologists during the last decades, yet the underlying forces shaping individual differences in habitat selection are poorly documented. Some of these differences could be explained by the early experience of individuals in their natal habitat. By selecting habitat attributes like those encountered early in life, individuals could improve resource acquisition, survival, and ultimately fitness. This behaviour, known as natal habitat preference induction (NHPI), could be particularly common in large mammals, because offspring generally stay with their mother for an extended period. We used three complementary approaches to assess NHPI in a marked population of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou): 1) population-based resource selection functions (RSFs), 2) individual-based RSFs, and 3) behavioural repeatability analyses. All approaches compared the behaviour of calves in their natal range to their behaviour as independent subadults during the snow-covered (Dec ñ Apr) and snow-free (May ñ Nov) seasons. Using RSFs, we found that the magnitude of habitat selection between calf and subadult stages differed for most covariates, yet the signs of statistically significant effects (selection vs. avoidance) were generally the same. We also found that some habitat selection tactics were highly repeatable across life stages. Notably, caribou responses to habitat disturbances were highly repeatable year-round, meaning that different individuals reacted differently, but consistently, to disturbances. This study highlights the potential role of natal habitat preference induction in shaping individual differences in habitat selection in large mammals and provides valuable knowledge for the management and conservation of a threatened species.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Repeatability data<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used to estimate repeatability of habitat selection in a boreal population of woodland caribou in Charlevoix, QuÈbec, Canada, 2004?2011, during the snow-covered and snow-free seasons.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">RepeatabilityData.xlsx<br></div></div>",Rangifer tarandus; Natal experience; behavioral repeatability,Canada; QuÈbec,2018-12-13,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4685,6,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,M,repository,.xlsx,no,Administrative unit,"Map, administrative unit",Rangifer tarandus caribou,2004-2011,source publication text,7,NA,7250,source publication text,other,,,,Ecology and Evolution,,,The source publication show geospatial information

The wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) is a terrestrial freshwater species listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Considering its conservation status and the paucity of information currently available on parentage relationship for the species, we performed a microsatellite analysis to study the mating system of wood turtles in the Shawinigan River (QuÈbec). We sampled 38 clutches over two years (14 in 2006 and 24 in 2007), for a total of 248 offspring genotyped with seven microsatellite loci. The reconstructed genotypes of the fathers revealed that reproductive success in the sampled clutches varied greatly between males and are positively correlated with the number of mates and clutches sired. Frequency of multiple paternity was estimated at 37% through a consensus of three different estimation methods. Positive correlation was observed between the genetic diversity of clutches and the number of fathers. Repeat paternity, however, was observed in 88% of the clutches by the same female in successive years, which suggests either a frequent use of sperm storage, or re-mating with the same partner in successive years.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data_PaternityAnalysis<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Microsatellite data for all the offspring and adults wood turtle used in the analysis.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.39jb0,Data from: Population genetics of the American eel (Anguilla rostrata): FST = 0 and NAO effects on demographic fluctuations of a panmictic species,"We performed population genetic analyses on the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) with three main objectives. First, we conducted the most comprehensive analysis of neutral genetic population structure to date in order to revisit the null hypothesis of panmixia in this species. Second, we used this data to provide the first estimates of contemporary effective population size (Ne) and to document temporal variation in effective number of breeders (Nb) in American eel. Third, we tested for statistical associations between temporal variation in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, the effective number of breeders and two indices of recruit abundance. A total of 2142 eels from 32 sampling locations were genotyped with 18 microsatellite loci. All measures of differentiation were essentially zero, and no evidence for significant spatial or temporal genetic differentiation was found. The panmixia hypothesis should thus be accepted for this species. Nb estimates varied by a factor of 23 among 12 cohorts, from 473 to 10 999. The effective population size Ne was estimated to be around 22 382. This study also showed that genetically based demographic indices, namely Nb and allelic richness (Ar), can be used as surrogates for the abundance of breeders and recruits, which were both shown to be positively influenced by variation during high (positive) NAO phases. Thus, long-term genetic monitoring of American glass eels at several sites along the North American Atlantic coast would represent a powerful and efficient complement to census monitoring to track demographic fluctuations and better understand their causes.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">genotype_age_location_Dryad2012<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">American glass eels recruitment begins in Florida around December and progresses northward to NewfoundlandñLabrador until June/July (Helfman et al. 1987). The first waves of glass eels at each location were sampled in 2008 following this latitudinal trend at 17 sites evenly distributed along eastern North America up to the St. Lawrence estuary. For each location, 50 individuals were measured and preserved in 95% ethanol. Yellow eels were also collected between May and September 2008 at 15 locations ranging from the upper St. Lawrence River to the Atlantic coast of Canada. The emphasis on yellow eel sampling in this region was motivated by the occurrence of strikingly different recruitment trends reported between Atlantic Canada versus the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario (Cairns et al. 2008). Sample size varied from 69 to 100 yellow eels per location. Fin clips were preserved in 95% ethanol for DNA extraction and genotyping, and heads were kept for otolith extraction. Yellow Eels collected in 2007 were finally rejected since they were frozen before being preserved in ethanol, wich caused a bias in microsattelits amplification. AGE DETERMINATION: Age was determined for 946 yellow eels, which allowed us to subdivide them into annual cohorts. Sagittal otoliths were extracted, stored in glass vials in a 95% ethanol: glycerine solution (1 : 1 ratio), and cleaned with successive baths of bleach, water, and 95% ethanol. Once dried, otoliths were embedded in a mix of epoxy resin and hardener (4:1 ratio) inside gelatine capsules for 24 h, ground to the core on the sagittal plane, and polished with alumina powder on a polishing disc. Sections were etched, decalcified in 5% EDTA for annuli enhancing, stained in 0.01% toluidine blue solution, and digitally photographed (e.g., Tremblay 2009). The first annulus after the dark central nucleus was considered as the elver check (metamorphosis from leptochephalus larva to glass eel) and subsequent annuli as winter checks (e.g., ICES 2011). Eels were considered by convention to be of age 0 + in their year of arrival in continental waters, and their ""cohort year"" was thus defined as so. Each otolith was aged twice by two eel experts to confirm aging. A total of 946 yellow eel otoliths were readable, representing 17 different cohorts, each comprising 1 to 127 individuals.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Abondance index variation and North Atlantic Oscillation Index<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">We tested for statistical associations among several combinations of the NAO time series and temporal fluctuations of three variables used as proxies of relative abundance. Variation in Nb was used as a proxy for relative variation in the number of breeders. Allelic richness (Ar), measured for each cohort, was used as a proxy for the relative abundance of recruits since it has previously been proposed to correlate with offspring recruitment (McCusker &amp; Bentzen 2010). YCSI was used as a second proxy of recruit abundance. We first tested for pairwise correlations between Nb, Ar, and YCSI, and time series of these three parameters were then compared with the monthly normalized NAO (http://www.cgd.ucar.edu). The ""corresponding year"" between time series represented the year when glass eels reached the continent for the Ar, Nb, and YCSI time series. To test environmental influence on previous life stages, +2 to -2 year lags were also tested. To assess the statistical significance of climate influence on eel abundance, multivariate models were run where the explanatory variables considered were the NAO time series. Stepwise regressions of the three relative abundance variables (Nb, Ar, and YCSI) were fitted to the explanatory variables to determine which ones were significant. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to select models. Cross-validation R2 was computed to determine the prediction strength of the selected model and semi-partial R2 were computed to assess the relative importance of each selected variable.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6g53s,Data from: Quantifying relative fish abundance with eDNA: a promising tool for fisheries management,"Assessment and monitoring of exploited fish populations are challenged by costs, logistics and negative impacts on target populations. These factors therefore limit large-scale effective management strategies.
Evidence is growing that the quantity of eDNA may be related not only to species presence/absence, but also to species abundance. In this study, the concentrations of environmental DNA (eDNA) from a highly prized sport fish species, Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush (Walbaum 1792), were estimated in water samples from 12 natural lakes and compared to abundance and biomass data obtained from standardized gillnet catches as performed routinely for fisheries management purposes. To reduce environmental variability among lakes, all lakes were sampled in spring, between ice melt and water stratification.
The eDNA concentration did not vary significantly with water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and turbidity, but was significantly positively correlated with relative fish abundance estimated as catch per unit effort (CPUE), whereas the relationship with biomass per unit effort (BPUE) was less pronounced.
The value of eDNA to inform about local aquatic species distribution was further supported by the similarity between the spatial heterogeneity of eDNA distribution and spatial variation in CPUE measured by the gillnet method.
Synthesis and applications. Large-scale empirical evidence of the relationship between the eDNA concentration and species abundance allows for the assessment of the potential to integrate eDNA within fisheries management plans. As such, the eDNA quantitative method represents a promising population abundance assessment tool that could significantly reduce the costs associated with sampling and increase the power of detection, the spatial coverage and the frequency of sampling, without any negative impacts on fish populations.",#N/A,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">eDNA DATA_ALR et al.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.zs7h44j7m,Data from: Seasonality of floral resources in relation to bee activity in agroecosystems,"<p>The contribution of wild insects to crop pollination is becoming increasingly important as global demand for crops dependent on animal pollination increases. If wild insect populations are to persist in agricultural landscapes, there must be sufficient resources over time and space. The temporal, within?season component of floral resource availability has rarely been investigated, despite growing recognition of its likely importance for pollinator populations. Here, we examined the visitation rates of common bee genera and the spatiotemporal availability of floral resources in agroecosystems over one season to determine whether local wild bee activity was limited by landscape floral resource abundance, and if so, whether it was limited by the present or past abundance of landscape floral resources. Visitation rates and landscape floral resources were measured in 27 agricultural sites in Ontario and QuÈbec, Canada, across four time periods and three spatial scales. Floral resources were determined based on species?specific floral volume measurements, which we found to be highly correlated with published measurements of nectar sugar mass and pollen volume. Total floral volume at varying spatial scales predicted visits for commonly observed bee genera. We found <i>Lasioglossum</i> and <i>Halictus</i> visits were highest in landscapes that provided either a stable or increasing amount of floral resources over the season. <i>Andrena</i> visits were highest in landscapes with high floral resources at the start of the season, and <i>Bombus</i> visits appeared to be positively related to greater cumulative seasonal abundance of floral resources. These findings together suggest the importance of early?season floral resources to bees. <i>Megachile</i> visits were negatively associated with the present abundance of floral resources, perhaps reflecting pollinator movement or dilution. Our research provides insight into how seasonal fluctuations in floral resources affect bee activity and how life history traits of bee genera influence their responses to food availability within agroecosystems.</p>","<p><strong>Study sites and landscape structure</strong></p>

<p>The study was conducted in 27 farms growing fruit or vegetable crops in Eastern Ontario and the Outaouais region of QuÈbec, Canada (map of sites in Figure S1). Farms planning to grow cucurbit crops were chosen initially for inclusion because we wished to focus on pollinator?dependent, late?season crops; however, many farms were not able to grow cucurbits due to drought conditions experienced throughout the region. To maximize independence among farm sites (i.e., to minimize the chance that an individual bee could move between farms), chosen farms were 4ñ211 km apart. Across all farm sites, 102 locations were sampled for bees and floral resource abundance (as described below), with one to six locations per farm, depending on the number of distinct land patches in which resource?providing flowers were present, and when permission was given from landowners. Sampling locations within patches of land were selected based on the estimated location of the patch's centre or, if the patch was over 25 m wide, was located at least 10 m from an edge. In three patches wider than 25 m, sampling locations less than 10 m from the edge were used due to a complete absence of flowers in bloom in the centre. The distance between sampling locations within a farm ranged from 3.8 m to 1,040 m. Sites were visited in rotation over four time periods during one season in 2016: the first took place in late spring, between May 20 and June 10 (n = 38 sampling locations), the second in early summer, from June 10 to July 4 (n = 33), the third in mid?summer, from July 5 to August 1 (n = 37), and the fourth in late summer, from August 1 to September 1 (n = 39). If sampling locations contained open flowers during more than one sampling period, the same location was sampled in multiple time periods.</p>

<p>The composition of the landscape within 250, 500, and 750 m radii of each sampling location was quantified to estimate landscape?scale floral resource abundance. The 250ñ750 m scale has been found in previous studies to be the range at which non?<em>Apis</em> bees respond to landscape structure (Steffan?Dewenter et al., 2002), and 500 m was chosen as an intermediate spatial scale. Sampling locations within the same farm site (and with overlapping radii at the 750 m scale) were not treated as independent (see Statistical analysis). Within a 750 m radius around each sampling location, the boundaries between land patches were manually digitized in QGIS version 2.18.7, using both waypoints taken on?site with a TrimbleÆ Juno SD handheld GPS unit (Trimble Navigation Limited), and from Google Earth and Bing Aerial satellite imagery.</p>

<p>Each land patch was then categorized by the type of land?use (hereafter, ""land type""), through ground?truthing and raster imagery from Agriculture and Agri?Food Canada's (AAFC) 2016 Annual Crop Inventory. Land types fell into three categories: non?resource land, resource?providing land, and unknown land (see Table S1 for detailed descriptions of each land type). Non?resource land was defined as any area that did not provide floral resources, which included crops with exclusively wind?pollinated flowers and crops with anecdotal or no evidence of bees collecting resources from flowers. Urban and developed land, which comprised approximately 8.5% of all area surrounding sampling locations, was also included in non?resource land; although residential gardens may provide floral resources for bees, the amount is inconsistent over time and space (Cane, 2005; Matteson et al., 2008) and appeared in our study to be highly variable across locations. Furthermore, other components of urban and developed land (e.g., pavement, mown lawns) are often devoid of floral resources. Resource?providing land was defined as land areas that provided floral resources for bees at some point during the season and was categorized into 14 different land types (Table S1). Sampling locations were located only within resource?providing land, and at least one of each resource?providing land type was sampled during each time period. Unknown land was comprised of areas where we could not determine the crop grown (2.3% of all area surrounding sampling locations); hedgerow (1.8%); crop land where potentially resource?providing crops were grown, but floral resources were not measured (0.7%); and soybean (10%), which is of uncertain value as a floral resource for bees. There is some anecdotal evidence for cross?pollination by honey bees resulting in increased soybean yields (Ahrent &amp; Caviness, 1994; Erickson et al., 1978), and 29 species of wild bees (including eight of the species observed in this study) have been found visiting soybean in Delaware, Wisconsin, and Missouri, USA (Rust et al., 1980). However, many varieties of soybean are cleistogamous, or self?fertilize before flowers open, and insect pollination of Ontario?grown varieties is not expected to increase yields (OMAFRA, 2015).</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:bold;""><strong>Bee observations</strong></span></p>

<p>Bee observation methods were adapted from frequently used pollinator surveying designs (AlarcÛn et al., 2008; Gibson et al., 2011; Memmott, 1999). At each sampling location, a transect was set up to survey bee activity within a 30 m ◊ 4 m area (89 transects); a 30 m ◊ 2 m area was surveyed when only one crop row (&lt; 4 m wide) was present (eight transects); and 25 m ◊ 4 m (one transect) or 24 m ◊ 4m areas (four transects) were surveyed when crop rows were shorter than 30 m. Bee observations occurred over 1 min per 4 m2 of transect intervals by slowly walking the length of the transect. The shaded and unshaded temperature, maximum wind speed, and average wind speed were recorded for at least 1 min using a KestrelÆ 2000 Pocket WeatherÆ Meter (Nielsen?Kellerman) held at approximately 1.5 m above ground preceding each observation period. If there was a noticeable change in conditions during the observation period, temperature and wind speed were recorded again at the end of the period and averages were recorded. All bee observations were conducted when shaded temperatures were above 11.9∞C (mean ± SD = 25.3∞C ± 4∞C), average wind speeds were below 1.9 m/s, and maximum wind speeds were below 4 m/s.</p>

<p>During observation periods, all occurrences of bees visiting open flowers were recorded by two observers, standing on either side of the transect width, and recording all visits within 2 m each. A visit was counted when a bee was seen contacting sexual organs of an entomophilous flower or was probing a flower for nectar. All visited flowers were identified to genus (9 out of 77 taxa) or species (68 out of 77 taxa), and bees were identified on the wing to genus or species. When identification was not possible on the wing, observations were paused and both observers attempted to catch the bee to take a photograph from inside a glass vial or to collect it as a voucher (79 specimens total). Vouchers were then identified to species or genus and are stored in the Forrest laboratory's collection at the University of Ottawa (Ottawa, ON, Canada). Overall, 82% of bees were identified to species, 17% to genus, 0.1% to family, and 1% as Anthophila. The full list of bee taxa can be found in Table S2.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:bold;"">Floral resources</span></p>

<p>Floral density was recorded at each sampling location, using three quadrats of 1.5 m ◊ 1.5 m. Quadrats were placed in random locations within the same transect used for bee observations, immediately following the observation period. If no open flowers were present in all three quadrat locations, an additional location was randomly selected and the mean count across the four quadrats was recorded. Within a quadrat, the number of open flowers was counted for each nongraminoid species encountered; for species with many?flowered inflorescences, five individuals were haphazardly selected, and the number of flowers was counted on a randomly selected inflorescence. The mean number of flowers per inflorescence for many?flowered species was then multiplied by the number of inflorescences in a quadrat to obtain the number of flowers per quadrat. In members of the Asteraceae family, capitula were treated as single flowers (see Table S3 for descriptions of floral units used for counts of each species). For 29 out of 96 species encountered, the number of flowers per inflorescence was obtained from either literature sources or digital images of herbarium specimens because of the large number of flowers encountered in the field or because (in a few cases) the species was inadvertently overlooked in the field (see Table S3 for literature values for each species).</p>

<p>To estimate the amount of floral resources (nectar and pollen) provided by a species, floral dimensions were measured on five haphazardly selected individuals of each species. The length and width of the receptacle (or capitulum in Asteraceae species) were measured at right angles to each other, as well as the height from the receptacle to the end of the longest sexual organ (stamen or pistil); in species with sexual organs completely hidden within a corolla, height was measured from the receptacle to the end of the corolla. Measurements were made using calipers and were rounded to the nearest 1 mm. Thirty?one of 96 species were not measured in the field, and floral measurements were instead obtained from literature sources or digital images of herbarium specimens (see Table S3 for measurements and literature sources for each species). Floral measurements were used to calculate both the surface area of flowers (<i>A </i>= ?<i>ab</i>) and the volume of flowers (<i>V</i> = ?<i>abh</i>), where a is the semi?major axis, or half the length or width (whichever was longest) of a flower's receptacle or capitulum, b is the semi?minor axis, or half the length or width (whichever was shortest) of a flower's receptacle or capitulum, and h is the height of a flower or inflorescence (Figure 2c and Table S3).</p>

<p>To determine which measurement of floral dimensions was the best proxy for floral resource amount, literature searches for daily nectar sugar mass (µg/day) and pollen volume (in µl/flower) were conducted for all flowering species encountered; these measurements have been previously used to assess floral resources available to pollinators (Baude et al., 2016; Hicks et al., 2016). Literature sources that provided counts of pollen grains per flower and volumes of individual pollen grains were used to calculate an estimate of pollen volume per flower for species for which we could not find measurements of total pollen volume. Nectar sugar mass was obtained for 46 species and pollen volume for 33 species of the 96 encountered (see Tables S4ñS5 for full species lists). Pearson correlations between nectar sugar mass or pollen volume and the length, width, height, surface area, and volume measurements of each species (all variables log?transformed to approximate normal distributions) were used to determine which floral dimension could best estimate the amount of floral resources. In addition, to determine whether the source of floral volume measurements (literature, in?field measurements, or combination of both; see Table S3) influenced the relationship between floral volume and either nectar or pollen, we ran ANCOVAs on daily nectar sugar mass and pollen volume as functions of floral volume, measurement source, and their interaction. The interaction was nonsignificant for both nectar (F<sub>2,40</sub> = 0.82, p = .45) and pollen (F<sub>2,28</sub> = 0.18, p = .83), indicating that it was reasonable to combine data sources.</p>

<p>For all bee genera other than <em>Peponapis</em>, the abundance of floral resources in the landscape surrounding each sampling location was calculated by determining the mean floral resource value per flower of each species and multiplying this value by the count of each flower in a quadrat. <em>Peponapis</em> collect pollen exclusively from squash (<em>Cucurbita</em> spp.; Hurd et al., 1974), and we only observed <em>Peponapis</em> visiting squash and cucumber (<em>Cucumis</em> <em>sativus</em>) flowers (both Cucurbitaceae). Therefore, in models of <em>Peponapis</em> visits, the abundance of floral resources in the landscape surrounding each sampling location was calculated from the mean floral resource value per squash or cucumber flower. While other bee genera such as <em>Andrena</em> likely included some oligolectic (pollen?specialist) species, we included all rewarding plant taxa in calculations of floral resources for genera other than <em>Peponapis</em>, as oligolectic species would make up a much smaller proportion of the total than in <em>Peponapis</em>. Furthermore, collectively, all oligolectic species within other genera would likely be specialized on pollen from multiple taxonomic groups, rather than a single family as in <em>Peponapis</em>. The mean abundance of floral resources per 1 m2 was then calculated across quadrats for each transect, and the median of the transect?level values was calculated for each land type during each time period. This number was then multiplied by the total area of each land type within 250, 500, and 750 m around a sampling location to obtain an estimate of the total floral resources at a given spatial scale during a given time period.</p>","<p>Guezen_Forrest_shapefiles_2021 folder: See ReadMe file included.</p>

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qs1h4,Data from: Striking phenotypic variation yet low genetic differentiation in sympatric lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush),"The study of population differentiation in the context of ecological speciation is commonly assessed using populations with obvious discreteness. Fewer studies have examined diversifying populations with occasional adaptive variation and minor reproductive isolation, so factors impeding or facilitating the progress of early stage differentiation are less understood. We detected non-random genetic structuring in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) inhabiting a large, pristine, postglacial lake (Mistassini Lake, Canada), with up to five discernible genetic clusters having distinctions in body shape, size, colouration and head shape. However, genetic differentiation was low (FST = 0.017) and genetic clustering was largely incongruent between several population- and individual-based clustering approaches. Genotype- and phenotype-environment associations with spatial habitat, depth and fish community structure (competitors and prey) were either inconsistent or weak. Striking morphological variation was often more continuous within than among defined genetic clusters. Low genetic differentiation was a consequence of relatively high contemporary gene flow despite large effective population sizes, not migration-drift disequilibrium. Our results suggest a highly plastic propensity for occupying multiple habitat niches in lake trout and a low cost of morphological plasticity, which may constrain the speed and extent of adaptive divergence. We discuss how factors relating to niche conservatism in this species may also influence how plasticity affects adaptive divergence, even where ample ecological opportunity apparently exists.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">MARIN_Mistassini_lake trout<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">All genetic, morphological and ecological data used for analyses in Striking Phenotypic Variation Yet Low Genetic Differentiation in Sympatric Lake Trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush<i>).

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.679s1dt,Data from: Temporal dynamics in animal community assembly during post-logging succession in boreal forest,"Species assemblages can result from deterministic processes, such as niche differentiation and interspecific interactions, and from stochastic processes, such as random colonisation and extinction events. Although changes in animal communities following disturbances have been widely examined, few studies have investigated the mechanisms structuring communities during ecological succession. We assessed the impact of logging on small mammal and beetle assemblages in landscapes dominated by old-growth boreal forests. Our objectives were to 1) characterize variations in communities during the first 66 years of post-harvest forest succession, 2) determine if there are non-random patterns of species co-occurrence (i.e., deterministic processes), and if there are, 3) establish whether non-random co-occurrences are best explained by habitat attributes or by interspecific interactions. We captured small mammals and beetles along a gradient of forest succession (5-66 years) and in old-growth forest, and characterized key vegetation attributes. First, we tested whether community compositions in clear-cut stands became similar to those in natural stands after 66 years. We then used null models, which were either unconstrained or constrained by habitat attributes, to address the last two objectives and distinguish effects of vegetation attributes from interspecific interactions on community assembly. We showed that beetle assemblages differed in stands 21-30 years post-harvest compared to old-growth forests. In contrast, harvesting did not influence the composition of small mammal communities. Overall, our results suggest that community assembly during forest succession is driven by both stochastic and deterministic processes, the latter being linked to interspecific interactions more strongly than to vegetation attributes.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">2007_2011_small_mammals_vegetation<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Small mammals were sampled in 53 sites in 2007 (37 logged stands, and 16 old-growth forests) and 34 sites in 2011 (17 logged stands and 17 old-growth forests).

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bcc2fqz9c,Data from: The island syndrome hypothesis is only partially validated in two rodent species in an inland-island system,"<p><span>According to the island syndrome and island rule hypotheses, island isolation and reduced area lead to phenotypic shifts in ecologically relevant traits in insular populations compared to mainland ones. These hypotheses have been built up with oceanic islands in mind or islands where isolation is high and colonization rate relatively limited. This set of hypotheses, however, may not be applicable to other inland-island systems or recently fragmented landscapes. </span></p>
 
 <p><span>We investigated how island life leads to phenotypic changes in two rodent metapopulations: deer mice and red-backed voles in a fragmented system on a river in Canada. From 2013 to 2016, we sampled 454 deer mice and 665 red-backed voles spread across 10 islands and six mainland sites on river shores. We compared body mass, tail and hindfoot length, exploration, and reaction towards predators, between individuals from island and mainland sites, and assessed the role of connectivity, isolation and area of islands. </span></p>
 
 <p><span>Insular individuals from both species were less aggressive towards potential predators and insular mice were more thorough explorers compared to mainland ones. Male mice were heavier and juvenile mice had longer tails on islands. However, contrary to expectations, we found negative relationships between aggressiveness and juvenile exploration score with patch connectivity for mice. Island connectivity significantly affected tail length of mice through a concave relationship. Finally, vole aggressiveness and exploration of male mice were positively correlated to island isolation. </span></p>
 
 <p><span>Our study supports only partially the predictions of the island syndrome hypothesis. It provides empirical evidence that inland-island life can modify traits in deer mice, but less so in red-backed voles in a non-oceanic system. It also raises questions about the direct causal factors of these changes in a naturally fragmented landscape, and urges for more predictive models about phenotypic/genetic divergence among populations in natural and artificial fragmented landscapes.</span></p>","<p>The study area was located within the Winnipeg River system, in the Minaki area (49∞59?11?N 94∞40?12?W), north-western Ontario, Canada</p>

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.nt511dp,Data from: The role of ecotype-environment interactions in intraspecific trophic niche partitioning subsequent to stocking,"Worldwide, stocking of fish represent a valuable tool for conservation and maintenance of species exploited by recreational fishing. Releases of hatchery-reared fish are more and more recognized to have numerous demographic, ecological and genetic impacts on wild populations. However, consequences on intraspecific trophic relationships have rarely been investigated. In this study, we assessed the impacts of supplementation stocking and resulting introgressive hybridization on the trophic niches occupied by stocked, local and hybrid Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) within populations of piscivorous and planktivorous ecotypes stocked from a wild piscivorous source population. We compared trophic niches using stable isotope analysis (?13C and ?15N) and trophic position among the three genetic origins. Putative genetic effects were tested with phenotype-genotype association of ""life history"" ecological traits (body size, growth rate, condition index and trophic niche) and genotypes (RADseq SNP markers) using redundant discriminant analysis (RDA). Results showed that sympatry resulting from the stocking of contrasting ecotypes is a risk factor for niche partitioning. Planktivorous populations are more susceptible to niche partitioning, by competitive exclusion of the local fish from a littoral niche to an alternative pelagic/profundal niche. Observed niche partitioning is probably a manifestation of competitive interactions between ecotypes. Our results emphasize that ecotypic variation should be considered for more efficient management and conservation practices and in order to mitigate negative impact of supplementation stocking.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">R script - Stable isotope analyses<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This file provides all the R codes (scripts) necessary to conduct preliminary and statistical analysis on stable isotopes data for this article.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.b46k4,Data from: Threshold dynamics in plant succession after tree planting in agricultural riparian zones,"Trajectories of plant communities can be described by different models of plant succession. While a Clementsian (gradual continuum model) or Gleasonian approach (relay floristics model) has traditionally been used to inform restoration outcomes, alternative succession models developed recently may better represent restoration trajectories. The threshold dynamics succession model, which predicts an abrupt species turnover after an environmental threshold is crossed, has never been used in a restoration context. This model might, however, better describe shifts in plant competitive ranking and facilitation interactions during species turnover.
 Fifty-three riparian zones, planted with trees 3ñ17 years prior to sampling, and 14 natural riparian forests were studied in two agricultural watersheds of south-eastern QuÈbec (Canada). The cover of vegetation strata was assessed at the site scale, and the cover of plant species was estimated in a total of 784 1-m2 plots. Canopy cover was measured stereoscopically for each plot.
 As revealed by Principal Response Curves and broken stick models, herbaceous species composition was stable during the first 12ñ13 years after tree planting, but then abruptly shifted. This two-step pattern in species turnover followed the increase in canopy cover after tree planting. Once canopy cover passed a threshold of ca 40%, plant succession started and led to the re-establishment of forest communities 17 years after planting.
 Following herbaceous species turnover, the cover of ecological groups changed significantly towards covers of natural riparian forests: shade-tolerant species generally increased, while light-demanding and non-native species decreased. Vegetation structure was also significantly affected by tree planting: tree and shrub cover increased, while monocot cover decreased.
 Synthesis and applications. Tree planting efficiently restored herbaceous forest communities in riparian zones by inducing a species turnover mediated by light availability corresponding to the threshold dynamics model in plant succession. Fostering and monitoring canopy closure in tree-planted riparian zones should improve restoration success and the design of alternative strategies. The innovative statistical approach of this study aiming to identify succession patterns and their associated theoretical models can guide future restoration in any type of ecosystem around the world to bridge the gap between science and management.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data_Bourgeois_et_al_2016_JApplEcol<div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",Succession models; Vegetation recovery; Herbaceous communities; Canopy cover; riparian zones; Agricultural landscapes,,2016-04-15,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12675,8,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.xlsx,site IDs,no,site coordinates,c.150 plant species,2012,source publication text,>1,no,200,no,density,,,,Journal of Applied Ecology,,,
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.7qt30vf,Data from: Trophic structure modulates community rescue following acidification,"Community rescue occurs when a community that experiences a lethal stress persists only through the spread of rare types, either genotypes or species, resistant to the stress. Rescue interacts with trophic structure because a physical stress experienced by a focal assemblage within the community may also be experienced by its predators and prey. In general, trophic structure will facilitate rescue only when a stress has a less severe effect on a focal assemblage than on its predators. In other circumstances, when stress affects prey or has only a weak effect on predators, trophic structure is likely to hamper rescue. We exposed a community of phytoplankton and zooplankton derived from a natural lake to acidification in outdoor mesocosms large enough to support trophically complex communities. Rescue of the phytoplankton from severe acidification was facilitated by prior exposure to sublethal stress, confirming previous results from microcosm experiments. Even communities that have previously been less highly stressed were eventually rescued, however, probably because their zooplankton predators were more sensitive to acidification and became extinct. Our experiment shows how community rescue following severe stress is modulated by the differential effect of the stress relative to trophic level.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data for Bell et al. 2019 Proc B<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Spreadsheet containing the pH, phytoplankton, and zooplankton measurements taken in all mesocosms on all sampling occasions.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.p2r8r,Data from: Using dynamic N-mixture models to test cavity limitation on northern flying squirrel demographic parameters using experimental nest box supplementation.,"1. Dynamic N-mixture models have been recently developed to estimate demographic parameters of unmarked individuals while accounting for imperfect detection. 2. We propose an application of the Dail and Madsen (2011: Biometrics, 67, 577-587) dynamic N-mixture model in a manipulative experiment using a before-after control-impact design (BACI). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis of cavity limitation of a cavity specialist species, the northern flying squirrel, using nest box supplementation on half of 56 trapping sites. Our main purpose was to evaluate the impact of an increase in cavity availability on flying squirrel population dynamics in deciduous stands in northwestern QuÈbec with the dynamic N-mixture model. We compared abundance estimates from this recent approach with those from classic capture-mark-recapture models and generalized linear models. We compared apparent survival estimates with those from Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) models. 3. Average recruitment rate was 6 individuals per site after 4 years. Nevertheless, we found no effect of cavity supplementation on apparent survival and recruitment rates of flying squirrels. Contrary to our expectations, initial abundance was not affected by conifer basal area (food availability) and was negatively affected by snag basal area (cavity availability). 4. Northern flying squirrel population dynamics are not influenced by cavity availability at our deciduous sites. Consequently, we suggest that this species should not be considered an indicator of old forest attributes in our study area, especially in view of apparent wide population fluctuations across years. 5. Abundance estimates from N-mixture models were similar to those from capture-mark-recapture models, although the latter had greater precision. Generalized linear mixed models produced lower abundance estimates, but revealed the same relationship between abundance and snag basal area. Apparent survival estimates from N-mixture models were higher and less precise than those from CJS models. However, N-mixture models can be particularly useful to evaluate management effects on animal populations, especially for species that are difficult to detect in situations where individuals cannot be uniquely identified. They also allow investigating the effects of covariates at the site level, when low recapture rates would require restricting classic CMR analyses to a subset of sites with the most captures.",#N/A,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Priol et al. 2014.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.xd2547dj8,Data set for combined influence of food availability and agricultural intensification on a declining aerial insectivore,"<p>Aerial insectivores show worldwide population declines coinciding with shifts in agricultural practices. Increasing reliance on certain agricultural practices is thought to have led to an overall reduction in insect abundance that negatively affects aerial insectivore fitness. The relationship between prey availability and the fitness of insectivores may thus vary with the extent of agricultural intensity. It is therefore imperative to quantify the strength and direction of these associations. Here we used data from an 11-year study monitoring the breeding of Tree Swallows (<em>Tachycineta bicolor</em>) and the availability of Diptera (their main prey) across a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern QuÈbec, Canada. This gradient was characterized by a shift in agricultural production, whereby landscapes composed of forage and pastures represented less agro-intensive landscapes and those focusing on large-scale arable row crop monocultures, such as corn (<em>Zea mays</em>) or soybean (<em>Glycine max</em>) that are innately associated with significant mechanization and agro-chemical inputs, represented more agro-intensive landscapes. We evaluated the landscape characteristics affecting prey availability, and how this relationship influences the fledging success, duration of the nestling period, fledgling body mass, and wing length as these variables are known to influence the population dynamics of this species. Diptera availability was greatest within predominately forested landscapes, while within landscapes dominated by agriculture, it was marginally greater in less agro-intensive areas. Of the measured fitness and body condition proxies, both fledging success and nestling body mass were positively related to prey availability. The impact of prey availability varied across the agricultural gradient as fledging success improved with increasing prey levels within forage landscapes yet declined in more agro-intensive landscapes. Finally, after accounting for prey availability, fledging success was lowest, nestling periods were the longest, and wing length of fledglings were shortest within more agro-intensive landscapes. Our results highlight the interacting roles that aerial insect availability and agricultural intensification have on the fitness of aerial insectivores, and by extension how food availability may interact with other aspects of breeding habitats to influence the population dynamics of predators.</p>",#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,2022-02-07,#N/A,4,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.csv,site IDs,no,no,diptera (in general.

In birds, and especially for migratory species, assessing these rates is challenging because of the difficulties involved in tracking individuals beyond fledging. Here we assessed the determinants of nest box local recruitment and natal dispersal distances in a declining aerial insectivore, the Tree swallow (<em>Tachycineta bicolor</em>). We used a 16-year dataset obtained from the long-term monitoring of a population breeding within a 10,200-km<sup>2</sup> study system located along a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern QuÈbec, Canada. Yearly nest box local recruitment rates ranged there in between 1.0% and 3.2%. Heavier nestlings who fledged earlier were more likely to recruit. Natal dispersal distances were generally short (mean ± SD = 12.7 ± 13.8 km) in the study system and were influenced by different factors depending on sex. Females dispersed over shorter distances when conspecific occupancy on breeding site was high, while males dispersed farther in the presence of competing House sparrows (<em>Passer domesticus</em>) and when their mother was young. Selection of breeding locations appeared to take place at multiple scales and individuals recruited in sites with characteristics similar to their natal sites. Our results provide important information concerning the factors influencing nest box local recruitment and natal dispersal dynamics of this migratory species. These factors should be considered in conservation practices for this species in order to support production of recruits in habitats favorable to their survival.</p>",,,,,2021-11-08,,6,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,M,repository,.csv,site IDs,no,Map,Tachycineta bicolor,no,NA,16,source link abstract,10200,source link abstract,density,,,,Oikos,,,"Geospatial information is southern QuÈbec, Canada.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.pg4f4qrs4,Environmental nucleic acids: a field-based comparison for monitoring freshwater habitats using eDNA and eRNA,"<p>Nucleic acids released by organisms and isolated from environmental substrates are increasingly being used for molecular biomonitoring. While environmental DNA (eDNA) has received attention recently, the potential of environmental RNA as a biomonitoring tool remains less explored. Several recent studies using paired DNA and RNA metabarcoding of bulk samples suggest that RNA might better reflect ""metabolically active"" parts of the community. However, such studies mainly capture organismal eDNA and eRNA. For larger eukaryotes, isolation of extra-organismal RNA will be important, but viability needs to be examined in a field-based setting. In this study we evaluate (a) whether extra-organismal eRNA release from macroeukaryotes can be detected given its supposedly rapid degradation, and (b) if the same field collection methods for eDNA can be applied to eRNA. We collected eDNA and eRNA from water in lakes where fish community composition is well documented, enabling a comparison between the two nucleic acids in two different seasons with monitoring using conventional methods. We found that eRNA is released from macroeukaryotes and can be filtered from water and metabarcoded in a similar manner as eDNA to reliably provide species composition information. eRNA had a small but significantly greater true positive rate than eDNA, indicating that it correctly detects more species known to exist in the lakes. Given relatively small differences between the two molecules in describing fish community composition, we conclude that if eRNA provides significant advantages in terms of lability, it is a strong candidate to add to the suite of molecular monitoring tools.</p>","<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sampling was conducted at the IISD Experimental Lakes Area (IISD-ELA), a remote research and monitoring facility in north-western Ontario, Canada. We sampled two lakes in summer and autumn of 2017 and repeated the summer and autumn sampling in five lakes in 2018. There are 14 species of fish across all the study lakes (mean 8, range 6-10 species per lake). All lakes have overlapping community compositions, including Salvelinus namaycush, a cold-water top predator, in every lake. Water samples were taken at six depths, dispersed vertically throughout the water column at the deepest centre point of each lake. The sampling points were distributed at six evenly spaced intervals, but because the lakes were different depths, absolute measurements differ between the lakes. One 500 ml water sample was taken per depth (for a total of 6 samples per lake per season) using an electrical pump and Jayflex PVC tubing (Winnipeg Johnston Plastics, MB, Canada) secured to a weight. In total, 84 water samples were taken throughout the entire study (6 samples x 2 lake states x 7 lake replicates). Water was filtered onto 47 mm 0.7 ?m pore GF/F filters using an electric vacuum pump and filtering manifold (Pall Corporation, ON, Canada). The filters were divided into two with scissors which had been bleached, rinsed and autoclaved. Half of each filter was immediately stored in screw-cap tubes at -20 ?C. The other half was preserved in 370?l RLT buffer (Qiagen) with 1% ?-mercaptoethanol and then frozen at -20∞C for RNA analysis. One negative control of 500 ml distilled water was stored in the cooler and filtered in the same way as the field samples for each lake. In total, 84 eDNA and 84 eRNA samples were taken across the entire study. Filters were shipped on dry ice to McGill University, MontrÈal for molecular analysis.</p>
 <p class=""MsoNormal"">DNA was extracted from filters using the Qiagen Blood and Tissue kit following the manufacturer's instructions except that 370?l of ATL buffer was added to the filter used in an initial overnight incubation step. After incubation, 325?l of fluid was transferred into an autoclaved microtube for the downstream extraction protocol. RNA was extracted from the filter halves preserved in RLT and ?-mercaptoethanol. Extractions of eRNA were performed from the first half of the filter using the Qiagen RNEasy Mini kit with some modifications to accommodate the filter. Filters were vortexed for 20 seconds and centrifuged in the RLT/ ?-mercaptoethanol buffer for 3 minutes at 14,000rpm. A total of 325?l of this buffer was mixed with 325?l ethanol and the rest of the procedure followed the kit protocol intended for extracting total RNA from animal cells. The eRNA was resuspended in two elutions of 30?l RNAse free water to give a final volume of 60?l.</p>
 <p class=""MsoNormal"">To avoid DNA contamination in the eRNA samples, DNA was digested from 20µl eRNA extracts with the DNA-freeô DNA Removal Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions and using 2µl DNase I Buffer, 1µl rDNase I and 2µl DNase Inactivation reagent. RNA samples were checked for residual contaminating DNA using PCR amplification using the MiFish-U primers tagged with Illumina sequencing adapters (Miya et al., 2015). These primers target a hypervariable region of the 12S rRNA locus (163-185bp in length). We used the following PCR chemistry: 7.4µl nuclease free water (Qiagen), 1.25µl 10X buffer (Genscript), 1 mM MgCl2 (ThermoFisher Scientific), 0.2mM GeneDirex dNTPs, 0.05mg bovine serum albumen (ThermoFisher Scientific), 0.25mM each primer, 1U taq (Genscript) and 2µl DNA in a final volume of 12.5µl. We followed a touchdown thermocycling protocol which we have found reduces the amount of non-specific amplification (bacterial taxa) at this locus: 95∞C for 3 minutes, 12 cycles of touchdown PCR (98∞C for 20 seconds, 66∞C for 15 seconds decreasing by 0.2∞C each time, 72∞C for 15 seconds) followed by 28 cycles with an annealing temperature of 64∞C, 72∞C extension for 5 minutes. We then visualised the resulting PCR products on 1% agarose gels stained with SYBR Safe. No residual contaminating DNA was found in eRNA samples. A total of 10?l of sample was therefore reverse transcribed into cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) in 20µl reactions following the kit instructions.</p>
 <p class=""MsoNormal"">We then amplified the cDNA and eDNA in triplicate 12.5µl reactions following the MiFish-U PCR protocol laid out above, and checked amplification using 1% agarose gels with SYBR Safe. We then combined the triplicate reactions into one sample and performed a cleanup with AMPure beads using a ratio of 1 part PCR product to 1.2 parts beads. Cleaned amplicons were then dual-indexed using the Nextera v2 DNA indexes, and cleaned again with a ratio of 1 part PCR product to 0.8 parts beads. The second clean-up was performed using a Biomek FX Laboratory liquid handling Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter, CA). Samples were equimolarised to 3ng/?l and sent for sequencing at GÈnome QuÈbec, MontrÈal. Samples were sequenced using 2 x 250bp paired end sequencing with an Illumina MiSeq.</p>
 <p class=""MsoNormal"">We used custom scripts to remove adapters, merge paired sequences, check quality and generate amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs). Samples were received as demultiplexed fastq files from GÈnome QuÈbec. Non-biological nucleotides were removed (primers, indices and adapters) using cutadapt. Paired reads were merged using PEAR. Quality scores for sequences were analysed with FASTQC. Amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) were generated using the UNOISE3 package, which uses a denoising pipeline to remove sequencing error and to cluster sequences into single variants (100% similarity). The full pipeline is available from https://github.com/CristescuLab/YAAP. After ASVs were generated, we assigned taxonomy using BLAST+ and BASTA, a last common ancestor algorithm. We used a custom reference database which contained only fish known to exist in the Lake of the Woods region (Ontario, CA), downloaded from the NCBI database on 12 August 2018.</p>",<p>See ReadMe file.</p><p>Funding provided by: Canada Research Chairs<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804<br>Award Number: 230517</p><p>Funding provided by: Canada Research Chairs<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804<br>Award Number: 237170</p><p>Funding provided by: Mitacs<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004489<br>Award Number: IT08003</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: 04331-2017</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: 2016-04016</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: 523760-2018</p><p>Funding provided by: Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: WSP Montreal Environment department*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p>,environmental DNA (eDNA); metabarcoding analysis; eRNA; 12S mitochondrial gene; freshwater biodiversity; freshwater fishes,,2022-06-16,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.01.469845; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6478222,8,zenodo,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ontario
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.0rxwdbs2c,Exploration and diet specialization in eastern chipmunks - QuÈbec - Canada,"<p>Individual diet specialization (IDS) is widespread and can affect the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations in significant ways. Extrinsic factors (e.g., food abundance) and individual variation in energetic needs, morphology, or physiology, have been suggested as drivers of IDS. Behavioral traits like exploration and boldness can also impact foraging decisions, although their effects on IDS have not yet been investigated. Specifically, variation among individuals in exploratory behavior and their position along <span>the exploration/exploitation trade-off </span>may <span>affect their foraging behavior, acquisition of food items and home-range size, which may in turn influence</span> the diversity of their diet. Here we analyzed stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in hair of wild eastern chipmunks, <em>Tamias striatus,</em> to investigate the influence of individual differences in exploration on IDS. We found that exploration profile, sex, and yearly fluctuations in food availability explained differences in the degree of dietary specialization and in plasticity in stable carbon and stable nitrogen over time. Thus, consistent individual differences in exploration can be an important driver of within-population niche specialization and could therefore affect within-species competition. Our results highlight the need for a more thorough investigation of the mechanisms underlying the link between individual behavioral differences and diet specialization in wild animal populations.</p>","<p>From 2012 to 2016, we live-trapped wild eastern chipmunks, <em>Tamias striatus,</em> within three sites near Mansonville, southern QuÈbec, Canada (45∞05'N; 72∞25'W) on rectangular grids of 7.84 ha (sites†1 and 2) and 4.00 ha (site†3), in mixed northern hardwood forests. We ran linear trapping transects composed of Longworth traps placed every 40 m and alternately placed along parallel adjacent transects. We trapped daily during the activity period of chipmunks from early May until early September every year.†At each capture, we recorded identity, sex, body mass, and age.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><strong>Exploration test</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">We quantified among-individual differences in exploration using a novel environment test in an open-field arena on 396 individuals from 2012 to 2017.†The experimental arena consists of an empty white box (80 ◊ 80 ◊†40 cm), with no refuge, and a grid marked on the bottom. This arena was placed at the center of the trapping grid. Before the test, we placed the captured individual for one minute in an opaque tubular entrance for acclimation. Exploration in the novel environment was video recorded for 90 s. Using The Observer XT11 software (<em>Noldus</em>), an exploration score was calculated for each test by counting the number of lines crossed by an individual during 90 s (RÈale et al. 2007). We ran two tests per individual at 1-year intervals (generally during the first and the second year of life) to obtain a phenotypic value representative of the individual's life. We then obtained the exploration profile of each individual by calculating best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) for exploration using an LMM controlling for date, hour of the test, waiting time before the test, site, and number of trials, all specified as fixed effects, and year, chipmunk and experimenter IDs as random effects. We used a method proposed by Dingemanse et al. (2020) to account for the variance around the BLUPs in the statistical analyses.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><strong>Hair samples and stable isotope analysis </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">We collected hair samples from 107 adult individuals over four successive years from 2013 to 2016. Each hair-sampled individual had been tested for exploration during the study period. We cut the recent darker hair before and after molting in late June, close to the skin, at the same place on the right thigh.†Samples of the main food items available (except fungi and insects) were collected between June and October 2013 and dried until constant weight before measuring isotope values (<em>?</em><sup>15</sup>N/<em>?</em><sup>13</sup>C).</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">The protocol for isotopic analysis followed Dammhahn and Goodman (2014). Isotope data are presented in â <em>?</em><sup>15</sup>N relative to nitrogen in air or <em>?</em><sup>13</sup>C relative to Pee Dee Belemnite calculated as follows: <em>?</em>X = [(Rsample<em>/</em>Rstandard) ? 1] ◊ 103, where <em>?</em>X is either <em>?</em><sup>15</sup>N or <em>?</em><sup>13</sup>C, and R is the respective <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N or <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio. For quantification of <em>?</em><sup>15</sup>N and <em>?</em><sup>13</sup>C, approximately 1 g of total dry hair was enclosed into tin capsules and processed through an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. We carried out mass spectrometry analyses on the 2013-14 hair and food source samples at the Center for Stable Isotope Research &amp; Analysis (KOSI) in Gˆttingen (Germany) using an isotope ratio mass spectrophotometer (Delta Plus, Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany). We carried out the analyses on the 2015-16 samples at the GEOTOP laboratories of the UniversitÈ du QuÈbec ‡ MontrÈal (MontrÈal, Canada), using an isotope ratio mass spectrophotometer (Isoprime 100, Elementar, Vario MicroCube). Internal reference materials are normalized on NBS†19-LSVEC for <em>?</em><sup>13</sup>C and on IAEA-N1, N-2 and N-3 for <em>?</em><sup>15</sup>N. To obtain non-biased niche width metrics (i.e., ellipse area, see below), we corrected the raw data for laboratory effects. We used two conservative linear models with the laboratory and year of analysis as fixed effects<em> </em>on <em>?</em><sup>15</sup>N and <em>?</em><sup>13</sup>C values as response variables. On GEOTOP data, we subtracted 0.57â in <em>?</em><sup>15</sup>N and added 0.38â in <em>?</em><sup>13</sup>C (i.e., estimates of laboratory effect).</p>
<p><strong>Red maple and American beech masting </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Chipmunks feed mostly on seeds from the dominant American beech and red maple and also the less common sugar maple (<em>Acer saccharum</em>) These tree species produce seeds in mast events every 2ñ3 years in southern QuÈbec. To quantify temporal variation in the availability of key food sources for chipmunks, we estimated red maple and American beech seed productions. We used 26 plastic buckets (with 0.06 m≤ opening) installed on two metallic poles at 50 cm above the ground and 1 m away from the trunk of a tree. On each site, we chose 8 to 13 mature red maple and 13 mature American beech trees uniformly distributed on the trapping grid and with a minimum circumference at breast height of 31 cm. We collected bucket contents twice yearly, in July and October. For each tree species, we calculated the average number of seeds collected per m≤.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9kd51c5dd,Genomic population structure of striped bass (Morone saxatilis) from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Cape Fear River,"<p>Striped Bass, Morone saxatilis (Walbaum, 1792), is an anadromous fish species that supports fisheries throughout North America and is native to the North American Atlantic Coast. Due to long coastal migrations that span multiple jurisdictions, a detailed understanding of population genomics is required to untangle demographic patterns, understand local adaptation, and characterize population movements. This study used 1256 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci to investigate genetic structure of 477 Striped Bass sampled from 15 locations spanning the North American Atlantic coast from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada to the Cape Fear River, United States (US). We found striking differences in neutral divergence among Canadian sites, which were isolated from each other and US populations, compared with US populations that were much less isolated. Our SNP dataset was able to assign 99% of Striped Bass back to six reporting groups, a 39% improvement over previous genetic markers. Using this method, we found (1) evidence of admixture within Saint John River, indicating that migrants from the US and from Shubenacadie River occasionally spawn in the Saint John River; (2) Striped Bass collected in the Mira River, Cape Breton, Canada were found to be of both Miramichi River and US origin ; (3) juveniles in the newly restored Kennebec River population had small and nonsignificant differences from the Hudson River; and (4) tributaries within the Chesapeake Bay showed a mixture of homogeny and small differences among each other. This study introduces new hypotheses about the dynamic zoogeography of Striped Bass at its northern range and has important implications for the local and international management of this species.</p>","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px;""><b><i>Sample Collection</i></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px;"">Fin clips and scales were taken from Striped Bass from multiple collections (Table 1). Age of sampled individuals differed by location. YOY juveniles were individuals less than 1 year old (&lt;15 cm long). Saint John juveniles were 1ñ4 years old and largely spawned in the year 2013. Ages for Saint John River juveniles were obtained from scales. Adults were sexually mature individuals aged 4 years and older. All adults collected were in spawning condition at time of sampling, except for Bras d'Or Lake, Mira River, and Shubenacadie River. Shubenacadie origin Striped Bass migrate to the Stewiacke-Shubenacadie systems from overwintering sites during the sampling period (DFO, 2014; Keyser, Broome, Bradford, Sanderson, &amp; Redden, 2016). Adult bass caught during this period are assumed to be of Shubenacadie River origin for the purpose of population surveys (DFO, 2014). Putative Miramichi River origin Striped Bass were included using fin clips taken from Striped Bass caught in the Bras d'Or Lake, Cape Breton that have previously been examined using microsatellites and found to match the Miramichi River population (Bentzen, Mcbride, &amp; Paterson, 2014). These samples will hereafter be referred to as Bras d'OrñMiramichi individuals.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px;""><b><i>Quality Control and Analysis</i></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px;"">SNPs were demultiplexed and filtered using modified versions of Eric Normandeau's Stacks workflow scripts, available on github (https://github.com/enorman deau/stacks_workflow, downloaded August 2016). Cutadapt v. 1.13 (Martin, 2011) was used to trim adapters from the raw sequences using a maximum error rate (e) of 0.2 and a minimum read length (m) of 50. FastQC v. 0.11.5 (Babraham Bioinformatics) was used to assess sequence quality before and after. Sequences were then trimmed to a uniform length of 85 bp and demultiplexed using the <i>process radtags</i> module of Stacks v. 1.46 (Catchen, Hohenlohe, Bassham, Amores, &amp; Cresko, 2013) using the paired end option ñP. BWA version 0.7.15 (Li &amp; Durbin, 2010) was used to align sequences to the Striped Bass genome (BioProject accession number PRJNA266827) using a minimum seed length (k) of 19, a maximum seed occurrence of 55, and no filtering on output alignment score, and otherwise default parameters. The stacks module <i>pstacks</i> identified reference aligned loci with a minimum depth (m) of 4 using the ""snp"" model type and an alpha of 0.1. Loci were assembled into a catalogue using <i>cstacks</i>, <i>sstacks</i>, and <i>rxstacks</i> with default settings, and unclear or unlikely haplotypes, as well as SNPs with a log likelihood &lt; 45, were pruned from the dataset. Using the <i>populations</i> module, SNPs were further filtered to remove all loci with a stack depth &lt;5, with greater than 20% missing data in any given location, and any loci not amplified in all locations. We examined the output of populations and removed loci with an Fis &lt; -0.3 to eliminate possible paralogs, and used VCFTools 0.1.13 (Danecek et al., 2011) to remove any loci with a minor allele frequency &lt; 0.01, and plink v. 1.90 (Chang et al., 2015) was used to remove loci in linkage disequilibrium with each other.</p>","structure_stripedbass_allLoci_noSibs

Due in part to multiple ancient whole genome duplication events, gene family expansion and subsequent evolution within†<i>Pinaceae</i>, false diversity from the misalignment of paralog copies creates further challenges in accurately and reproducibly inferring evolutionary history from sequence data. Here, we leverage the cost-saving benefits of pool-seq and exome-capture to discover SNPs in two conifer species, Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>†var.†<i>menziesii†</i>(Mirb.) Franco,†<i>Pinaceae</i>) and jack pine (<i>Pinus banksiana</i>†Lamb.,†<i>Pinaceae</i>). We show, using minimal baseline filtering, that allele frequencies estimated from pooled individuals show a strong positive correlation with those estimated by sequencing the same population as individuals (r &gt; 0.948), on par with such comparisons made in model organisms. Further, we highlight the utility of haploid megagametophyte tissue for identifying sites that are likely due to misaligned paralogs. Together with additional minor filtering, we show that it is possible to remove many of the loci with large frequency estimate discrepancies between individual and pooled sequencing approaches, improving the correlation further (r &gt; 0.973). Our work addresses bioinformatic challenges in non-model organisms with large and complex genomes, highlights the use of megagametophyte tissue for the identification of paralog sites, and suggests the combination of pool-seq and exome capture to be robust for further evolutionary hypothesis testing in these systems.</p>","<p>This data was collected from natural populations.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.hmgqnk9dq,Individual high-quality reads (dd-RADsequencing) from: Genomic signatures of clonality in the deep water kelp Laminaria rodriguezii,"<p><span>The development of population genomic approaches in non-model species allows for renewed studies of the impact of reproductive systems and genetic drift on population diversity. Here, we investigate the genomic signatures of partial clonality in the deep water kelp <i>Laminaria rodriguezii</i>, known to reproduce by both sexual and asexual means. We compared these results with the species <i>Laminaria digitata</i>, a closely related species that differs by different traits, in particular its reproductive mode (no clonal reproduction). We analysed genome-wide variation with dd-RAD sequencing using 4077 SNPs in <i>L. rodriguezii</i> and 7364 SNPs in <i>L. digitata</i>. As predicted for partially clonal populations, we show that the distribution of F<sub>IS</sub> within populations of <i>L. rodriguezii</i> is shifted toward negative values, with a high number of loci showing heterozygote excess. This finding is the opposite of what we observed within sexual populations of <i>L. digitata</i>, characterized by a generalized deficit in heterozygotes. Furthermore, we observed distinct distributions of F<sub>IS</sub> among populations of <i>L. rodriguezii</i>, which is congruent with the predictions of theoretical models for different levels of clonality and genetic drift. These findings highlight that the empirical distribution of F<sub>IS</sub> is a promising feature for the genomic study of asexuality in natural populations. Our results also show that the populations of <i>L. rodriguezii</i> analysed here are genetically differentiated and probably isolated. Our study provides a conceptual framework to investigate partial clonality on the basis of RAD-sequencing SNPs. These results could be obtained without any reference genome, and are therefore of interest for various non-model species.</span></p>","<p><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"" style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26);background:transparent;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">Individual reads available in the repository come from two double-digest RAD-sequencing libraries (ddRAD-seq), achieved by multiplexing 49 individuals of†</span><em style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26);background:transparent;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"" style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26);background:transparent;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">Laminaria rodriguezii</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"" style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26);background:transparent;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">†and 130 individuals of†</span><em style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26);background:transparent;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"" style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26);background:transparent;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">Laminaria digitata</span></em><em style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26);background:transparent;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"" style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26);background:transparent;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">,</span></em><em style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26);background:transparent;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"" style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26);background:transparent;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;""> </span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"" style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26);background:transparent;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">including 2 and 5 technical replicates, respectively (see Sample_information.txt).

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.612jm641c,Integrating functional connectivity in designing networks of protected areas under climate change: a caribou case-study,"<p>Land-use change and climate change are recognized as two main drivers of the current biodiversity decline. Protected areas help safeguard the landscape from additional anthropogenic disturbances and, when properly designed, can help species cope with climate change impacts. When designed to protect the regional biodiversity rather than to conserve focal species or landscape elements, protected areas need to cover a representative sample of the regional biodiversity and be functionally connected, facilitating individual movements among protected areas in a network to maximize their effectiveness. We developed a methodology to define effective protected areas to implement in a regional network using ecological representativeness and functional connectivity as criteria. We illustrated this methodology in the GaspÈsie region of QuÈbec, Canada. We simulated movements for the endangered Atlantic-GaspÈsie caribou population (<i>Rangifer tarandus caribou</i>), using an individual-based model, to determine functional connectivity based on this large mammal. We created multiple protected areas network scenarios and evaluated their ecological representativeness and functional connectivity for the current and future conditions. We selected a subset of the most effective network scenarios and extracted the protected areas included in them. There was a tradeoff between ecological representativeness and functional connectivity for the created networks. Only a few protected areas among those available were repeatedly chosen in the most effective networks. Protected areas maximizing both ecological representativeness and functional connectivity represented suitable areas to implement in an effective protected areas network. These areas ensured that a representative sample of the regional biodiversity was covered by the network, as well as maximizing the movement over time between and inside the protected areas for the focal population.</p>","<p>Starting from a published individual based model (Bauduin et al. 2016; Ecological Modelling), we simulated movements for the endangered Atlantic-GaspÈsie caribou population (<i>Rangifer tarandus caribou</i>) to determine functional connectivity based on this large mammal.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vmcvdncrn,Large-scale multi-trophic co-response models and environmental control of pelagic food webs in QuÈbec lakes,"<p>Environmental heterogeneity plays a fundamental role in driving species distributions by, for one, fostering niche dimensionality. Within lake ecosystems, species distributions and concordance patterns are driven by both local and regional heterogeneity, though their relative importance across trophic levels has rarely been explored. We developed a statistical framework to compare responses of taxa from different trophic levels to abiotic factors and determine how thisaffected multi-trophic network structures.In particular, we used multi-species concordance modelling (Concordance Analysis and RV coefficient) to determine species associations and correlations within and among three trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish communities sampled across 49 southern QuÈbeclakes, covering eight hydrological regions). We then used Multiple Factor Analysis, Latent Variable Modelling and Local Contributions of sites to Beta Diversity to assess the relative importance of major environmental gradients in structuring species co-responses and species interaction turnover across the landscape. Our analyses confirmed that concordant species within each trophic level varied jointly or segregated into different pelagic food webs in QuÈbec lakes where important acidification and eutrophication took place. Somekeynote species were indicators of different food web compartments and distinguished groups of lakes along multiple environmental niche dimensions. Among the three trophic levels examined, zooplankton depicted the highest proportion of species concordance and appeared to act as a trophic linkage between phytoplankton and fish. Ultimately, the losses or gains in species richness and species interactions were strongly driven by environmental gradients.This study provides for the first time a combined analysis of the effects of environmental heterogeneity on ecological communities belonging to three trophic levels sampled near simultaneously across an 800 km broad lacustrine landscape. The new framework developed in this study has a great potential to better understand the complex response of aquatic ecosystems in a world increasingly affected by multiple, cumulative stressors.</p>

The lakes are distributed along an 800 km south-west to north-east longitudinal geographical range (78∞to 63∞ W) and cover eight hydrographical regions. The present study was restricted to 49 lakes with complete data for asuite of morphometric, physical, chemical, and biotic variables, including three trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish communities). Plankton and fish communities were sampled during July and August 1982, thus capturing a key period of anthropogenic acidification and consequently one of the strongest spatial gradients in natural and anthropogenic lake acidity experienced in the region. To minimize the effect of the seasonal development on plankton communities, sampling started at successive times in the eight regions following the west-to-east geographic and climatic axis gradient over a period of 1 month. Phytoplankton species counts (87 species across all sites) were expressed as cells per millilitre; zooplankton species counts (34 species) were expressed as numbers of individuals per cubic metre and converted to biomass (milligrams per cubic metre) using specific dry mass relationships; fish counts (18 species) were expressed in abundances (catch per unit effort). Environmental variables examined provided information on the geography (latitude, longitude, and altitude), morphometry (lake and catchment areas, lake order, maximum and relative depths, length, width, and volume), and water quality (pH, ions, metals, alkalinity, alkalinity: sulfate ratio, organic and inorganic carbon, conductivity, transparency, colour, and the morphoedaphic index) of each study site. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>",<p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: 04875</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: 7738</p>,,,2021-03-04,,7,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,M,repository,.csv,"site IDs, site coordinates",no,Map,"88 phytoplankton species, 34 zooplankton species, 18 fish species",1982,"source link abstract, source publication text",>1,no,no,no,"presence only, abundance",,,,Oikos,,,"this dataset would be of High relevance, but the fact of having no geospatial iformation at all makes it Moderate, as well as in the source publication. location information are sites IDs.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.g4f4qrfs1,Miniaturization eliminates detectable impacts of drones on bat activity,"<p>A new way to survey wildlife populations may be possible with advancements in drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that render aerial technology more accessible and promote surveying in inapproachable habitats. However, it remains unclear whether UAV disturbance deters animals, which would make this method inaccurate for data collection and hazardous to wildlife welfare. This study addresses the viability of UAV use for wildlife research by measuring the effects of UAV flight on acoustic bat detection and comparing bat activity in response to varying UAV models. Depending on the way UAVs effect bat detection rate, it may be possible to identify whether wildlife surveys should be done with UAVs and the drone models best suited for this purpose. The results reveal that larger and louder UAVs deterred significantly more bats, and the smallest and quietest model had no effect on bat detection. Indeed, drone noise was positively correlated with drone size, but drone size had little effect on the range of frequencies emitted. While detecting bats with small and quiet UAVs may be possible, complications still arise with acoustic detection and the species-specific effects of drone flight. The reliability of automatic identification with the acoustic detecting software is limited, as over a quarter of detections were triggered by non-bat noises yet still classified as bats (25.99%). Overall, using drones for wildlife detection should be approached with caution, as this study illustrates that some drones deter and disturb wild bats. If drones are used in wildlife habitat, consider flying smaller and quieter models, which are significantly less disturbing. Otherwise, large and loud drones will likely deter more animals and skew the results of the survey.</p>","<p><span><span style=""font-style:normal;""><span><span style=""font-weight:normal;""><span style=""letter-spacing:normal;""><span><span><span style=""white-space:normal;""><span><span><span>We performed trials starting 30 min after dusk from 21h00 to 0h00, following the procedure described by Ednie et al.

At each site, we placed a control detector 250-400m away from the treatment, enough distance to attenuate drone noise but remain in similar habitat. Upon arriving to one of our eight detection sites, we began the first phase of the trial by attaching the Echo Meter Touch 2 plugin acoustic bat detector (Wildlife Acoustics, Maynard, MA, USA) to a tablet and initiating recording with the corresponding Wildlife Acoustics app (Wildlife Acoustics, Maynard, MA, USA). Phase 1 consisted of audio recording from the ground with the Echo Meter Touch 2 for five minutes with no drone activity. After five minutes, we began Phase 2 by setting up one of three drones for the randomly chosen treatment. We either launched the drone to 15 m above the site of detection where the drone remained hovering; or we carried the drone to a launch site 50 m away, ascended it to 15 m above the launch site, and then flew the drone above the detection site. The drone hovered in place for five min, and afterwards was returned to its launch site. Once we powered off the drone, we continued to Phase 3, i.e. another five min of audio bat detection with no drone disturbance. This completed the trial, then we repeated the procedure at a new site, conducting one trial at each site every night of the experiment.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.np5hqbzvd,Neutral and adaptive drivers of genomic change in introduced brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations revealed by pooled sequencing,"<p>Understanding the drivers of successful species invasions is important for conserving native biodiversity and for mitigating the economic impacts of introduced species. However, whole-genome resolution investigations of the underlying contributions of neutral and adaptive genetic variation in successful introductions are rare. Increased propagule pressure should result in greater neutral genetic variation, while environmental differences should elicit selective pressures on introduced populations, leading to adaptive differentiation. We investigated neutral and adaptive variation among nine introduced brook trout (<em>Salvelinus fontinalis</em>) populations using whole-genome pooled sequencing. The populations inhabit isolated alpine lakes in western Canada and descend from a common source, with an average of ~19 (range of 7-41) generations since introduction. We found some evidence of bottlenecks without recovery, no strong evidence of purifying selection, and little support that varying propagule pressure or differences in local environments shaped observed neutral genetic variation differences. Putative adaptive loci analysis revealed non-convergent patterns of adaptive differentiation among lakes with minimal putatively adaptive loci (0.001%-0.15%) that did not correspond with tested environmental variables. Our results suggest that (i) introduction success is not always strongly influenced by genetic load, (ii) observed differentiation among introduced populations can be idiosyncratic, population-specific, or stochastic, and (iii) conservatively, in some introduced species, colonization barriers may be overcome by support through one aspect of propagule pressure or benign environmental conditions.</p>","<p style=""text-align:left;"">This dataset was collected by sampling <em>Salvelinus fontinalis</em> from lakes in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and BC. DNA extractions from fin tissue were conducted using <em>Qiagen</em> blood and tissue kits (Qiagen, Germany) and the manufacturer protocol. To ensure equal quantities of DNA in the pooled samples, DNA quality and quantity were initially assessed by 1% Agarose gel electrophoresis using HindIII digested Lambda DNA run at 100V to assess possible DNA degradation. Multiple quality tests per individual were conducted on a <em>Qubit</em> Fluorometer 2.0 (Invitrogen, USA) selecting for quantity &gt;20 ng/µL and confirmed in a <em>NanoDrop</em> spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) as well as estimates of 260/230 and 260/280 ratios greater than &gt;1.8 quality.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Individual DNA was then pooled by sex, and population (18 total pools) with 20 individuals in each pool; exceptions were Cobb females (n=17) and both McNair sexes (n=8) due to low population and sample sizes. Twenty individuals per pool were chosen to ensure a balance between available population samples and to have equal representation between sexes (two pools of 20 per population) while maintaining accurate unbiased allele frequency estimates (Anand et al., 2016; Boitard et al., 2012). Albeit from different sexes, the adoption of two pools per population also provided a degree of sampling replication for some population genomic analyses, such as genomic-wide diversity and genetic differentiation. Fifty µL of each individual sample was selected for each pool at a dilution of 10 ng/µL, with DNA concentrations confirmed both prior to and post using a <em>Qubit</em> Fluorometer. DNA was pooled together at a final concentration of 3 ng/µL, confirmed using a <em>Qubit</em> Fluorometer.†</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Genomic libraries of these pooled DNA samples were prepared by GÈnome QuÈbec Innovation Centre, MontrÈal, QuÈbec, Canada via a shotgun approach with PCR with <em>Illumina TrueSeq</em> LT adaptors (Illumina, USA).† All pools passed quality and quantity requirements and were sequenced each on two lanes of <em>NovaSeq 6000 S4</em> flowcell (Illumina) and paired-end reads of 100 base pairs (bp). Coverage was estimated based on the assumption that the brook trout genome is approximately 3Gb, based on the Animal Genome Size Database (<a href=""http://www.genomesize.com/"">http://www.genomesize.com/</a>).</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:11px;text-align:left;"">A reference genome of charr (<em>Salvelinus </em>sp<em>.</em>) available from NCBI (ASM291031v2, Christensen et al., 2018; Genome size = ~2.4GB, scaffold N50 = 1.02Mbp, Contig N50 = 55.6Kbp, masked mapping) was used due to its close phylogenetic and karyotypic relationship with brook trout (Timusk et al., 2011). The reference genome was prepared using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) v 0.7.12 (Li &amp; Durbin, 2009), indexed with SAMtools v 1.5 (Li et al., 2009), and a dictionary was created using Picard tools v 2.17.11 (<a href=""http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/"">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</a>, accessed 20-11-2019) to permit sequence alignment.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:11px;text-align:left;"">SNP discovery was performed using the PPalign module of the PoolParty pipeline v 0.8 (Micheletti &amp; Narum, 2018); the methods and packages in this module are detailed below.

SNP filtering was carried out using common parameters for salmonid species, found below (Horn et al., 2020). Duplicate sequences and unpaired reads were filtered using SAMtools, BBMap, and Picard tools with a minimum fastq trimming length of 25bp. An indel window of 15bp was used to mask SNPs around indel regions. SNP calling was facilitated conservatively by BCFtools v 1.5 (Li et al., 2009) with a quality score of 20, a minimum global allele frequency of 0.05, and a minimum global coverage of 10.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1c59zw3zf,Occupancy modeling of habitat use by white-tailed deer after more than a decade of exclusion in the boreal forest,"<p>The exclusion of herbivores in forest areas is a strategy used to reduce the impact of selective browsing and increase the regeneration of desired plant species. On Anticosti Island (QuÈbec, Canada), selective browsing by white-tailed deer prevents the regeneration of balsam fir ñ white birch forests leading to their conversion into white spruce forests. Large deer exclosures were established for ca . 10 to 12 years in clear-cuts with patches of residual forest from 2001 to 2006 to assist in the natural regeneration of fir stands and to provide shelter and food resources for deer. Our objective was to assess how deer use exclosures after the removal of fences according to their spatial configuration and habitat composition. We randomly distributed automatic cameras for periods of 14 days during summer in six exclosures ranging from 3.1 to 11.2 km2 (n=25 cameras per exclosure) from which deer were reduced for 10 to 12 years. We compared candidate occupancy models that included spatial configuration and food resource variables while simultaneously controlling for variables affecting detection probability. We obtained weak evidence that deer habitat use increased by 19% when forage resources, represented by the cover of <em>Cornus canadensis</em>, increased from 0 to 100%. None of the other variables (distance between the border of exclosures and cameras and distance between forest patches and cameras) was retained, suggesting that the use of regenerating forests by deer in summer after a period of exclusion is related to forage availability and therefore, any forest management that improves food production during summer should help maintain or increase habitat use by deer.</p>","<p>During the summer of 2020 (25 June ñ 16 August), we distributed 25 cameras (Bushnell Trophy, Spypoint Force 10, Reconyx PC800 and Spypoint Force 20) in each of the six exclosures according to a stratified random distribution in 3 different habitat types (regenerating cuts, residual mature forest without balsam fir [representing forest cover] and residual mature forest with balsam fir [representing forest cover and food resources]).</p>
 <p>We deployed each camera as accurately as possible to the random locations. We mounted cameras at level, 75 cm from the ground on trees with a diameter at breast height of 8 to 10 cm and facing the North quadrant. We removed vegetation obstructing the camera's lens. Cameras recorded pictures for 14 days in each exclosure, taking a systematic picture every 5 minutes for a total of 288 pictures per day. </p>
 <p>To classify automatically the presence and absence of white-tailed deer, we analyzed 485,338 pictures collected during 2,100 camera trap days using an artificial intelligence from Tan and Le (2019). We classified the pictures with the neural network/architecture EfficientNet from the EfficientNet-Pytorch library (Melas-Kyriazi 2020). We used a sample of 2968 pictures pre-classified as deer presence (n=1484) and absence (n=1484) to train the model and 636 pictures to validate the model efficiency. The model classified the pictures with a degree of precision of 94%. </p>
 <p>To estimate visibility and model the detection probability of each camera, we used a profile board composed of four panels of 50 x 25 cm to estimate the lateral cover in front of the camera. We took a measure at 5 and 10 meters in front of each camera, and then estimated the percentage of visibility at each site, following the approach in Ferron et al. (1996). The approach consist of averaging the grade of lateral cover of four squares on a blanket held vertically in front of the evaluator (1: 0-19% of visibility, 2: 20-39%, 3: 40-59%, 4: 60-79%, 5: 80-100%), then multiplying it by 20 and deducing 10, for example: ((1 + 3 + 4 + 4) / 4) * 20 ñ 10 = 50 % of lateral cover visibility at 5 m in front of the camera. The same approach was used at 10 m. We also recorded whether the camera was pointing at a deer trail or not.</p>
 <p>At each camera trap site, we surveyed all saplings and merchant trees present per species in a circular area of 100 m2 (5.64 m radius) centered on the camera. We tallied saplings per species and diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.3 m) classes to compute basal area per species.</p>
 <p>We measured vegetation of the ground layer in a 4 m2 circular plot located at 2 m in front of each camera. We estimated the percentage of cover of common herbaceous plants regularly browsed by deer on the island: Cornus canadensis, Maianthemum canadense, Chamaenerion angustifolium, Clintonia borealis, Rubus sp., and Poaceae sp. We kept only two species for the analysis (i.e., C. canadensis and Rubus spp.) because the global presence of the other species at all camera trap sites was less than 4%, and therefore their availability was not high enough to include these species in the analysis.</p>
 <p>To define spatial configuration, we used ArcMap tools (ArcGIS v10.4; Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redland, CA, USA), to measure the distance of the closest forest cover and the shortest distance to the exclosure border (m) for each camera trap site. When the camera was located under forest cover, we set the distance at 0.</p>
 <p>To obtain convergence, we scaled all the covariates (MacKenzie et al. 2018). Pairwise correlations between all variables were all below 0.48. </p>",<p>Data files require Excel to be open</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: RDCPJ525308-18</p>,,,2022-09-01,,7,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.xlsx,site IDs,no,"Map, administrative unit",white-tailed deer,2020,source link abstract,>1,no,no,no,presence-absence,,,,Wildlife Biology,,,Anticosti Island - Should have higher relevance because of this?
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.m63xsj45g,Plant litter chemistry controls coarse-textured soil carbon dynamics,"<p>1. As soils store more carbon (C) than the Earth's atmosphere and terrestrial biomass together, the balance between soil C uptake in the form of soil organic matter and release as CO2 upon its decomposition is a critical determinant in the global C cycle regulating our planet's climate. Although plant litter is the predominant source of C fueling both soil C build-up and losses, the issue of how litter chemistry influences this balance remains unresolved.</p>
 <p>2. As a contribution to solving that issue, we traced the fate of C during near-complete decomposition of 13C-labelled leaf and root litters from 12 plant species in a coarse-textured soil. We separated the soil organic carbon (SOC) into mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) and particulate organic matter (POM) pools, and investigated how 14 litter chemical traits affected novel SOC formation and native SOC mineralization (i.e., the priming effect) in these soil fractions.</p>
 <p>3. We observed an overall net increase in SOC due to the addition of litter, which was stronger for root than for leaf litters. The presumed stable MAOM-C pool underwent both substantial stabilization and mineralization, whereas the presumably less stable POM-C pool showed substantial stabilization and reduced mineralization. Overall, the initial increase in soil C mineralization was fully counterbalanced by a later decrease in native soil C mineralization. POM-C formation as well as MAOM-C formation and mineralization were positively related to the initial litter lignin concentration and negatively to that of the nitrogen leachates, whereas the opposite was observed for POM-C mineralization.</p>
 <p>4. Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of litter chemical traits for SOC formation, and stabilization, destabilization, and mineralization. In our coarse-textured soil, the amount of MAOM-C did not change despite large C fluxes through this pool. The litter chemical traits that drove these processes differed from those frequently reported for fine-textured soils far from mineral-associated C saturation. To account for these discrepancies, we propose an integrative perspective in which litter quality and soil texture interactively control soil C fluxes by modulating several SOC stabilization and destabilization mechanisms. Irrespective, our results open new critical perspectives for managing soil C pools globally.</p>",<p>Data collection is described in the corresponding article; the archieved data (except for the litter chemical traits) represent means across 3 repetitions.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.g1jwstqqx,Testing the precision and sensitivity of density estimates obtained with a camera-trap method revealed limitations and opportunities,"<p>The use of camera traps in ecology helps affordably address questions about the distribution and density of cryptic and mobile species. The Random encounter model (REM) is a camera-trap method that has been developed to estimate population densities using unmarked individuals. However, few studies have evaluated its reliability in the field, especially considering that this method relies on parameters obtained from collared animals (<i>i.e.</i> average speed, in km/h), which can be difficult to acquire at low cost and effort. Our objectives were to (1) assess the reliability of this camera-trap method and†(2)†evaluate the influence of parameters coming from different populations on density estimates. We estimated a reference density of black bears (<i>Ursus americanus</i>) in Forillon National Park (QuÈbec, Canada) using a spatial capture-recapture estimator based on hair-snag stations. We calculated average speed using telemetry data acquired from four different bear populations located outside our study area and estimated densities using the REM. The reference density, determined with a Bayesian spatial capture-recapture model, was 2.87 individuals/10km<sup>2</sup> [95% CI: 2.41ñ3.45], which was slightly lower (although not significatively different) than the different densities estimated using REM (ranging from 4.06ñ5.38 bears/10km<sup>2 </sup>depending on the average speed value used). Average speed values obtained from different populations had minor impacts on REM estimates when the difference in average speed between populations was low. Bias in speed values for slow-moving species had more influence on REM density estimates than for fast-moving species. We pointed out that a potential overestimation of density occurs when average speed is underestimated, i.e. using GPS telemetry locations with large fix-rate intervals. Our study suggests that REM could be an affordable alternative to conventional spatial capture-recapture, but highlights the need for further research to control for potential bias associated with speed values determined using GPS telemetry data.</p>","<p>We estimated a ""reference density""†using a hair-snag genotyping survey and a DNA-based capture-recapture statistical method. We divided the study area into 37 irregular cells of ~7.5†km<sup>2</sup> and placed a hair-snag station as close as possible to the center of 33 of these cells; the four remaining cells were discarded due to their inaccessibility and steep slopes.†Hair-snag stations were composed of two barbwires fixed on tree trunks 35 cm and 65 cm aboveground to delineate an enclosure of 5 x 5 m. Scent lures were used to attract bears in the hair-snag stations in order to increase the probability of ""capture"". Three types of scent lures were used: a mustelid lure in a pierced plastic bottle was hung in the air at the center of the station, while 100 mL of seal oil was applied to a wood pile in the middle of the station (on the ground), and a 1:1 mix of vegetable oil and anise oil was sprayed on tree trunks found within the barbwire section of the station. Lures were refreshed every week. Stations were sampled for 5 weeks, from 6 July to 18 August 2015, as black bears usually increase their movement rate at this time, increasing the probability of recapture and consequently yielding more precise density estimates.†Stations were visited weekly and each hair sample was collected individually (i.e. multiple hairs tied on a single barb were considered one sample) and identified to record its location on the barbwire (lower vs. upper barbwire, and barb ID-#). After each visit, the barbwires were burned using a blowtorch to prevent DNA contamination between sessions. Each hair sample was stored in a paper envelope with silica desiccant and freeze-dried for 24 hours.†All samples were sent to Wildlife Genetic International (hereafter WGI) for genotyping. Hair samples were subselected based on the ""Mowat 1-in-3"" method, developed by WGI ; this method offers a good compromise between genotyping many samples that belong to the same individual and missing genetic material from other individuals. DNA was extracted from the samples using QIAGEN DNeasy tissue kits, and the genotyping followed a standard three-phase approach (i.e. first pass, cleanup and error-check), using seven microsatellite markers (G10L, G10H, UarMU23, UarMU50, MSUT-2 and G10X) plus ZFX/ZFY for gender.</p>

<p>We used automated camera to estimate bear density with the Random Encounter Model. The encounter rate†was assessed using 47 remote cameras (Spypoint model I-6: n = 13 and model Tiny: n = 22; Reconyx model RM45: n = 4; Moultrie model A-7i: n = 8). All cameras used passive infrared and movement sensors, and the trigger sensitivity was set to its maximum. The cameras were programmed to take three consecutive pictures when triggered, and were randomly distributed within the 7.5-km<sup>2</sup> sampling cells by generating 10 random points in each cell; one to five of these points were then selected based on their accessibility (on foot or with an ATV).†The radius (r) of the camera detection zone was assessed through several trials during which a person crossed the camera detection zone perpendicularly. The detection arc (?) of the camera detection zone was assumed to be the value found in the specifications of each camera model.†At micro-site scale, the cameras were installed in a direction that provides a relatively clear detection zone, without being faced deliberately towards a trail used by wildlife. We removed branches and stems in front of the cameras to maintain consistency across cameras regarding the detection zone area and to reduce the number of empty pictures triggered by branch movements that trigger the sensors. At each selected point, a camera was fixed on a tree 75 cm aboveground for a minimum of 21 days, leading to the placement of 110 cameras from 1 July to 9 September 2015.†The average speed (i.e. movement rate, measured as the Euclidian distance between two successive relocations divided by the time elapsed between them) was not available for the study population (Forillon), so we used GPS telemetry data gathered from four different black bear populations in the province of QuÈbec during the last 19 years (see Table 1 for more details). For each dataset, we calculated average speed (v) and its standard error using only the relocations collected from July to September (i.e. the same period during which of our camera-trap and hair-snag data were collected) with a minimum fix-rate of 8 locations/day (i.e. 1 location every 3 hours) to reduce bias in the estimation of average speed.</p>",<p>Funding provided by: Parks Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014612<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: Discovery Grant #386661 to MH St-Laurent</p>,,,2022-04-23,,0,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,L,repository,.csv,sample coordinates,administrative unit,"Map, site coordinates",Ursus americanus,2015,source link abstract,>1,no,200,no,presence-absence,,,,Ecology and Evolution,,,

Here, we tested how seasonal variation in thermal stratification and animal habitat preferences influence the distribution of eDNA in lakes. We sampled eDNA depth profiles of five dimictic lakes during both summer stratification and autumn turnover, each containing warm- and cool-water fishes as well as the cold-water stenotherm, lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>). Habitat use by <i>S. namaycush</i> was validated by acoustic telemetry and was significantly related to eDNA distribution during stratification. Fish eDNA became ""stratified"" into layers during summer months, reflecting lake stratification and the thermal niches of the species. During summer months, <i>S. namaycush</i>, which rarely ventured into shallow waters, could only be detected at the deepest layers of the lakes, whereas the eDNA of warm-water fishes was much more abundant above the thermocline. By contrast, during autumn lake turnover, the fish species assemblage as detected by eDNA was homogenous throughout the water column. These findings contribute to our overall understanding of the ""ecology"" of eDNA within lake ecosystems, illustrating how the strong interaction between seasonal thermal structure in lakes and thermal niches of species on very localised spatial scales influences our ability to detect species.</p>","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px;""><b>eDNA metabarcoding</b></p>
 
 <p style=""margin-bottom:11px;"">Sampling was conducted at the IISD Experimental Lakes Area (IISD-ELA), a remote research and monitoring facility in north-western Ontario, Canada. We sampled two lakes in summer and autumn of 2017 and repeated the summer and autumn sampling in five lakes in 2018. There are 14 species of fish across all the study lakes (mean 8, range 6-10 species per lake). All lakes have overlapping community compositions, including Salvelinus namaycush, a cold-water top predator, in every lake. Water samples were taken at six depths, dispersed vertically throughout the water column at the deepest centre point of each lake. The sampling points were distributed at six evenly spaced intervals, but because the lakes were different depths, absolute measurements differ between the lakes. We refer to the shallowest depth as sampling point one and the deepest depth as point six. Four 500 ml replicate water samples were taken per depth (for a total of 24 samples per lake per season) using an electrical pump and Jayflex PVC tubing (Winnipeg Johnston Plastics, MB, Canada) secured to a weight. In total, 336 samples were taken throughout the entire study (24 samples x 2 lake states x seven lake replicates). Water was filtered onto 47 mm 0.7 ?m pore GF/F filters using an electric vacuum pump and filtering manifold (Pall Corporation, ON, Canada). The filters were immediately stored in screw-cap tubes at -20 ?C and then shipped on dry ice to McGill University, MontrÈal for molecular analysis. DNA was extracted from filters using the Qiagen Blood and Tissue kit. All samples were treated with the OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, California). DNA was amplified in triplicate 12.5 µl reactions using 12S MiFish-U primers selected to target fish assemblages tagged with Illumina adapters. PCR replicates from each sample were combined and cleaned with a 1 : 0.875 ratio of AMPure beads. Samples were dual-indexed with v2 Nextera DNA indexes (Illumina). The samples were cleaned again with AMPure beads, quantified and equimolarised to 3 ng/?l for sequencing. Sequencing was conducted using 2 x 250 bp Illumina MiSeq at GÈnome QuÈbec, MontrÈal. We used custom scripts to remove adapters, merge paired sequences, check quality and generate amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs). Samples were received as demultiplexed fastq files from GÈnome QuÈbec. Non-biological nucleotides were removed (primers, indices and adapters) using cutadapt. Paired reads were merged using PEAR. Quality scores for sequences were analysed with FASTQC. Amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) were generated using the UNOISE3 package, which uses a denoising pipeline to remove sequencing error and to cluster sequences into single variants (100% similarity). The full pipeline is available from https://github.com/CristescuLab/YAAP. After ASVs were generated, we assigned taxonomy using BLAST+ and BASTA, a last common ancestor algorithm. We used a custom reference database which contained only fish known to exist in the Lake of the Woods region (Ontario, CA), downloaded from the NCBI database on 12 August 2018.</p>
 
 <p style=""margin-bottom:11px;""><b>Acoustic telemetry</b></p>
 
 <p style=""margin-bottom:11px;"">Salvelinus namaycush were captured by angling and surgically implanted with coded, acoustic, pressure-sensing telemetry tags (model V13P-1L; Vemco, Innovasea, Bedford, NS). Between five and ten tagged adults were monitored in each lake during the study period. The pressure sensor on each tag was calibrated in the lake it was deployed in prior to implantation to ensure accurate depth readings (resolution: 0.08-0.15 m). The tags randomly emitted signals every 120-300 s (lakes 373, 626 and 239) or every 110-250 s (lakes 223 and 224). A number of data logging receivers (VR2W, 69 kHz; Vemco, Innovasea, Bedford, NS) were deployed under water at specific locations in the lake such that the ""listening radius"" of each receiver (spherical volume ~350 m diameter) overlapped slightly with the other receivers, resulting in maximum coverage of the lake. Each receiver was attached to a floating buoy and suspended ~2 m below the water's surface or ~2-4 m above the bottom of the lake (dependent on mooring apparatus design). The receivers logged acoustic signals emitted by the tags through an omnidirectional hydrophone. Data (fish ID, date, time, pressure sensor reading) were continuously collected except when receivers were removed from the lake and downloaded (~8 h duration per lake, semi-annually). The pressure sensor data were converted to depth information using Vemco VUE software for each detection for the duration of the study (yielding ~200-700 depth detections for each fish in a typical 24-hr period). After downloading, duplicate detections (single tag signals detected by more than one receiver) were removed. In order to assess whether different time periods of cumulative eDNA persistence in the lakes affected the relationship between eDNA counts and telemetry data, we grouped telemetry data for each fish at different temporal scales, ranging from the day of eDNA sample collection, as well as one week, and one month prior to sample collection. The total number of detections of all fish were grouped into depth intervals reflecting the vertical distribution of the eDNA sampling (6 intervals per lake). We adjusted for varying depth interval size and variation in the total amount of telemetry detections for each lake over the relevant time period.</p>","<p>All instructions for use are found in the README file.</p>

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.tmpg4f51z,Using dietary metabarcoding analyses to characterise waterbirds-agriculture interactions,"<p>Globally, the use of agricultural fields by waterbirds has increased, resulting in conflicts with farmers. Designing effective management strategies to resolve these conflicts requires understanding the species' resource use. Dietary analyses can shed light on the extent of consumption of agricultural crops and surrounding natural resources, as well as the potential relationship between diet and an individual's body condition and ultimately its fitness. We examined the dietary composition of the tropical magpie goose (<em>Anseranas semipalmata</em>), seasonally utilising a mixed natural-agricultural landscape of northern Australia. We used DNA metabarcoding of intestinal contents from hunted geese to reconstruct individual diets and evaluated body condition from morphometric measurements. We compared the relative contribution of agricultural and natural foods to dietary composition, and investigated how this contribution varied spatially, temporally, and among individuals that differed in body condition. We found that geese consumed both agricultural and naturally occuring plants assigned to at least 35 taxa. The most frequent and abundant taxa belonged to three families: Poaceae (grasses), Cyperaceae (sedges), and Anacardiaceae (mangoes). Dietary composition varied substantially among sampling sites and over time but not with body condition of geese. <em>Synthesis and applications</em>. We used a novel approach to investigate the diet of a waterbird perceived as problematic across an agricultural landscape in tropical Australia. We showed that individuals forage opportunistically, and that agricultural crops, while eaten, may not represent an essential part of geese diet across the study region. The knowledge acquired provides new insights into the species' foraging ecology offering clear alternatives for mitigating goose-agriculture interactions. Providing disturbance-free alternative foraging areas or minimising the attractiveness of targeted agricultural fields (e.g., shorter grass, alternative ground cover) may alleviate crop consumption while benefiting the species' long-term conservation. While also highlighting the limitations of DNA metabarcoding, our dietary study emphasises the potential of this methodology to improve our understanding of crop damage by wildlife, allowing effective evaluation of management requirements.</p>",,<p>Funding provided by: Hort Innovation<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000981<br>Award Number: MG15005</p><p>Funding provided by: Charles Darwin University<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001803<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Fonds de recherche du QuÈbec ñ Nature et technologies<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003151<br>Award Number: </p>,Agriculture; crop protection; Diet Analysis; DNA metabarcoding; human-wildlife conflicts; geese; <i>rbcL</i>; Wildlife Management,,2022-08-05,,7,zenodo,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Australia
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.pg4f4qrpf,Variable strength of predator-mediated effects on species occurrence in an arctic terrestrial vertebrate community,"<p>Indirect effects resulting from species sharing the same enemy can shape spatio-temporal variations in species occurrence. The strength of such effects remains poorly known in natural communities composed of species from different trophic levels interacting in heterogeneous landscapes. Benefiting from a well-known arctic vertebrate community and marked spatio-temporal variations in the density of key prey species, we examined the effects of direct predator-prey and indirect predator-mediated effects on species occurrence in the landscape. We found both positive effects of one prey (lemmings), as well as negative indirect effects of another prey (colonial nesting snow geese) on the occurrence of species (ground-nesting birds) belonging to different guilds and trophic levels but sharing a common predator (arctic fox). However, species using prey refuges available in the landscape were not or less affected by predator-mediated effects. Similarly, the smallest (a passerine) and the largest and most dangerous species (an owl) for the shared predator were not affected by these effects. Our study provides one of the rare empirical evidence of predator-mediated effects ascending the food web (i.e., negative indirect effect of an herbivore on avian predators) and underlines how habitat structure and species traits can modulate the strength of indirect effects in natural communities.</p>","<p>The dataset provided here contains the data used in each of the models presented in the article ""Variable strength of predator-mediated effects on species occurrence in an arctic terrestrial vertebrate community"".

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.31zcrjdp5,Water availability dictates how plant traits predict demographic rates,"<p>A major goal in ecology is to make generalizable predictions of organism responses to environmental variation based on their traits. However, straightforward relationships between traits and fitness are rare and likely vary with environmental context. Characterizing how traits mediate demographic responses to the environment may enhance predictions of organism responses to global change. We synthesized 15 years of demographic data and species-level traits in a shortgrass steppe to determine whether the effects of leaf and root traits on growth and survival depend on seasonal water availability. We predicted that (1) species with drought-tolerant traits, such as lower leaf turgor loss point (TLP) and higher leaf and root dry matter content (LDMC and RDMC), would be more likely to survive and grow in drier years due to higher wilting resistance, (2) these traits would not predict fitness in wetter years, and (3) traits that more directly measure physiological mechanisms of water use such as TLP would best predict demographic responses. We found that graminoids with more negative TLP and higher LDMC and RDMC had higher survival rates in drier years. Forbs demonstrated similar yet more variable responses. Graminoids grew larger in wetter years, regardless of traits. However, in both wet and dry years, graminoids with more negative TLP and higher LDMC and RDMC grew larger than less negative TLP and low LDMC and RDMC species. Traits significantly mediated the impact of drought on survival, but not growth, suggesting survival could be a stronger driver of species' drought response in this system. TLP predicted survival in drier years, but easier-to-measure LDMC and RDMC were equal or better predictors. These results advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which drought drives population dynamics, and show that abiotic context determines how traits drive fitness.</p>","<p><strong>Demographic Data†</strong> We monitored growth and survival for eight graminoid and eight forb species in 24, 1-m∞†chart-quadrats from 1997 to 2010 at the Central Plains Experimental Research location (CPER) in Nunn, Colorado, USA (40.8 ∞N/110.8 ∞W). This North American shortgrass steppe is at 1650 m elevation and is dominated by Bouteloua gracilis and Bouteloua dactyloides. It receives an annual average of 340 mm of precipitation, and has a mean annual temperature of 8 ∞C (Chu et al. 2014) (Appendix S2: Section S1). The chart-quadrat method maps each plant in each year, but does not uniquely identify each individual. Plants with a sizeable basal area are mapped as polygons, while grasses and forbs with few stems are mapped as points. Graminoids in this analysis were measured as polygons, and forbs as points, so we use these functional groups in place of ""polygon"" or ""point."" Points representing forbs do not indicate plant size, so we can only measure growth for graminoids. We extracted growth and survival from a digitized version of this map dataset using ""tracking algorithms"" in R (version 4.0.3) (Lauenroth and Adler 2008, R Core Team 2021). These algorithms loop through the annual maps for a given quadrat, and assume that individuals of the same species growing in the same location in consecutive years are the same individual. In this way, the algorithms generate records of survival for all individuals, and records of growth or shrinkage for individuals measured as polygons. Individual plants can go dormant for up to several years, such that no above-ground material is visible.†Individuals were allowed to be 'dormant' for up to one year. These tracking scripts allow for a user-defined period of dormancy, which we set to the conservative limit of one year. This means that if an individual is present in year one, absent in year two, but present in year three at the same coordinates as year one, this plant is considered the same individual. We also allowed a ""buffer"" of 5 cm in observations of the same individual from year to year, which accounts for measurement error as well as true variation in re-sprouting location across years (Fair et al. 1999, Lauenroth and Adler 2008, Chu et al. 2014).†</p>
<p><strong>Trait Data</strong> We measured leaf and root traits for the 16 species in the demographic dataset. Five to ten mature, healthy individuals of each species were sampled for each trait. A majority of the values used in this analysis were collected at the CPER. However, several additional species were measured at the USDA-ARS High Plains Grasslands Research Station (HPGRS), a northern mixed-grass prairie 60 km from the CPER. In most cases, trait samples were collected from CPER and HPGRS between 2014 and 2018, and the associated data has been published (Blumenthal et al. 2020). For species without trait data from CPER or HPGRS, we used species-level trait values measured in 2018 and 2019 at Hays, KS, Miles City, MT and Dubois, ID. We calculated species mean values for seven traits: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf and root dry matter content (LDMC and RDMC), leaf turgor loss point (TLP), specific root length (SRL), average root diameter (RDiam), and root tissue density (RTD).†SLA and LDMC were measured using standard methods (PÈrez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013). TLP was calculated from measurements of leaf osmotic potential at full turgor made using a Vapro 5600 osmometer (Bartlett et al. 2012). TLP was derived from osmotic potential using the following equations: graminoid leaf turgor loss point = 0.944*(leaf osmotic potential) ñ 0.622, forb leaf turgor loss point = 0.80*(leaf osmotic potential) ñ 0.845 (Griffin-Nolan et al. 2019). Below ground traits were measured for fine, absorptive root tissue (typically 1st-3rd order roots) (McCormack et al. 2015). Intact absorptive root branches were extracted from soil monoliths that were sampled to 20 cm beneath the soil surface (Blumenthal et al., unpublished). Root length, average diameter, and root volume were measured using WinRhizo software (Regent Instruments, Inc., Ville de QuÈbec, QC Canada). Further details of leaf trait sampling and measurement protocols can be found in (Blumenthal et al. 2020).</p>","<p><strong>Demographic Data</strong>†The demographic data is in two files: one for that has data for species measured as points (forbs), and another that has data for species measured as polygons (graminoids).

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.pnvx0k6hq,Where to spend the winter? The role of intraspecific competition and climate in determining the selection of wintering areas by migratory caribou,"<p>Depicted as predictable movements, migrations can, however, show important interannual variations, making the conservation of migratory species particularly challenging. Plasticity in migratory behaviour allows individuals to adjust their migratory tactics to maximize their fitness. Destination of migration, and therefore migration patterns, may vary according to climatic and environmental conditions encountered during migration or at the arrival site but also according to competition. In Northern-QuÈbec and Labrador, Canada, fall migration patterns of caribou from the RiviËre-George (RGH) and the RiviËre-aux-Feuilles (RFH) herds have varied greatly during the last decades. Meanwhile, both herds have shown large fluctuations in abundance. We assessed the influence of environmental factors and changes in population size on wintering area selection. Based on 649 fall migrations of 284 females equipped with ARGOS collars, we used a machine-learning algorithm, the random forests, to assess how climate, resources and population size affected the selection of four different wintering areas. Individuals followed over several years switched to a different wintering area†45% of the time between consecutive years, and this probability increased at high population size. The main determinant of wintering area selection was the population size for both herds, suggesting intra- and inter-herd competition for wintering areas. The long migrations of RGH toward the western wintering areas, also used by RFH, were favoured when the herd was abundant and when the availability of resources was low at the departure. The migrations of RFH toward the south-western area increased as RGH declined, possibly because the past presence of RGH in this area reduced access for caribou from RFH. These results highlight the flexibility in the migratory behaviour of caribou in response to variation in competition. Our study is the first to suggest that wintering area selection can be determined by competition between populations of the same ungulate species.</p>",#N/A,<p>Datasets and R scripts required to run the hierachical cluster analysis and the random forests analyses</p>,Rangifer tarandus; winter range,#N/A,2019-12-17,https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.06668,4,zenodo,,,,NA,yes,H,repository,.txt,no,administrative unit,"Map, range coordinates",caribou,1991-2012,source publication text,21,NA,1000000,source publication text,presence only,,,,Oikos,,,

Then we tested if trait values are associated with commonness at seven spatial scales, ranging from abundance in 16-m≤ grassland plots, via regional and European-wide occurrence frequencies, to worldwide naturalization success.</p>

<p>3. At every spatial scale, commonness was associated with at least three traits. The traits explained the greatest proportions of variance for abundance in grassland plots (42%) and naturalization success (41%), and the least for occurrence frequencies in Europe and the Mediterranean (2%). Low root tissue density characterized common species at every scale, whereas other traits showed directional changes depending on the scale. We also found that many of the effects had significant non-linear effects, in most cases with the highest commonness-metric value at intermediate trait values. Across scales, belowground traits explained overall more variance in species commonness (19.4%) than aboveground traits (12.6%).</p>

<p>4. The changes we found in the relationships between traits and commonness, when going from one spatial scale to another, could at least partly explain the maintenance of trait variation in nature. Most importantly, our study shows that within grasslands, belowground traits are at least as important as aboveground traits for species commonness. Therefore, belowground traits should be more frequently considered in studies on plant functional ecology.</p>","<h3>Species traits</h3>

<h4><em>Species selection, seed material and precultivation</em></h4>

<p>The species used are herbaceous angiosperms occurring in the grassland plots of the German ""Biodiversity Exploratories"" (Fischer et al. 2010; Socher et al. 2012). In each of three regions of Germany, the Schw‰bische-Alb (south-western Germany), Hainich-D¸n (central Germany), and Schorfheide-Chorin (north-eastern Germany), 50 plots (4 m ◊ 4 m) were selected in grassland habitats covering a wide range of land-use intensities. From 2008 to 2016, the vegetation composition of each of the 150 plots was assessed annually in late spring by estimating the cover of each species. We standardized the species names according to the accepted names in †<a href=""http://www.theplantlist.org/"">http://www.theplantlist.org</a>, accessed on 15<sup>th</sup> June 2019, using the <i>Taxonstand</i> package (Cayuela et al. 2012) to allow us to align the species names between different distribution and trait datasets (see below). In total, 363 vascular plant species have been identified in the plots of the ""Biodiversity Exploratories"". For 311 of those species, we were able to obtain seeds from commercial seed suppliers or botanical gardens for our experiments (see Appendix S1 in Supporting Information). For <i>Alchemilla vulgaris agg.</i>, which also includes taxa that are difficult to distinguish from <i>A. vulgaris</i>, we used seeds from <i>A. vulgaris</i>. For <i>Leucanthemum vulgare agg.</i>, which includes both <i>L. vulgare</i> and <i>L. ircutianum</i>, we used seeds from both species and the trait values were averaged.</p>

<p>In two experiments, we measured functional traits on those species. Before the first experiment, we individually weighed 10 seeds, randomly chosen from the supplier's bag, for each of the 311 species. Then we did an indoor pot experiment to determine root morphology of the species, and an outdoor pot experiment to determine rooting depth. For both experiments, seeds were first sown in plastic pots (7 cm ◊ 7 cm ◊ 6.5 cm) filled with peat soil. The pots were then placed in a growth chamber for two to three weeks (night/day 9/15 h; 18/21 ± 1.5∞C; relative humidity 90 ± 5%) before transplanting the seedlings into the pots used for the experiments (for cultivation times, see Appendix S1). In addition to the traits measured in the experiments, we obtained data on aboveground traits (specific leaf area, height), bud-bank size and mycorrhizal status from databases (see the section ""Traits from databases and data imputation"" below).</p>

<h4><em>Experiment on root-system morphology</em></h4>

<p>From May 1 to October 6, 2017, we performed a glasshouse experiment to measure root-system morphological traits of the study species. As root morphology might depend on nutrient availability, we grew half of the plants per species at intermediate nutrient levels and the other half at high nutrient levels, after which we averaged the trait values per species. Because of the large number of species and the time-consuming measurements, we grew the plants in four temporally shifted (4-6 weeks) batches. We aimed to have each species represented in each batch, and to have a total of seven replicates per species and nutrient level across all batches (Appendix S1). The seedlings of the species that had germinated (N=233) were transplanted individually into plastic pots (1.3 L) filled with a mixture of sand and vermiculite (1:1 volume ratio). The pots were then randomly allocated to positions in two glasshouse compartments, and allowed to grow for four weeks (night/day 10/14 h; 22/28 ± 1.5∞C; relative humidity 80 ± 15%). Plants were fertilized three times a week with either an intermediate nutrient solution (40 ml with 1500 µM KNO<sub>3</sub>) or a high nutrient solution (40 ml with 12000 µM KNO<sub>3</sub>). The fertilizer was a modified version of the Hoagland recipe (see Appendix S2).</p>

<p>We grew the plants for four weeks only to avoid roots becoming pot-bound, to be able to analyse the entire root systems, and to ensure that all the belowground biomass was formed by roots, excluding rhizomes. After washing off the substrate, the root system was cut below the collar and stored for &lt;1 week in a plastic tube filled with distilled water at 4∞C. Then, root systems were spread individually in a thin layer of water in transparent trays (11 cm ◊ 11 cm) and scanned at 800 dpi with a flatbed scanner modified for root scanning (Epson Expression 10000 XL and 11000 XL). The images were analysed using the software WinRHIZO<sup>TM </sup>2017a (Regent Instruments, Quebec, Canada) to obtain the total root length and root volume. Root systems were then oven-dried for &gt;48 hours at 65∞C and weighed. We calculated specific root length by dividing the total root length by the belowground dry biomass, and root tissue density by dividing the belowground dry biomass by the sum of the root volumes according to Rose (2017). The diameter of fine roots (i.e. distal roots), thought to be the most important roots for nutrient uptake (Freschet and Roumet 2017), was determined by randomly sampling a distal root branch (or a portion of it) for each root system and calculating the mean of the external-internal links diameter obtained with the ""Link analysis"" function in WinRHIZO<sup>TM</sup>. This subsampling avoided the inclusion of thicker transport roots and allowed us to obtain values that were representative for first order roots. We also dried and weighed the aboveground biomass of each plant, and calculated the root weight ratio (i.e. root biomass divided by total biomass).</p>

<h4><em>Experiment on rooting depth</em></h4>

<p>From the 15<sup>th</sup> of May to the 10<sup>th</sup> of October 2018, we performed an outdoor pot experiment to measure the maximum rooting depth of the species. Up to five seedlings of the species that had germinated (n=196; Appendix S1) were transplanted individually into 120 cm tall plastic tree shelter tubes (Tubex Æ Standard Plus, <a href=""http://www.tubex.com/products/tree-shelters/tubex-standard-treeshelters/specification.php"">http://www.tubex.com/products/tree-shelters/tubex-standard-treeshelters/specification.php</a>), which are normally used in forestry to protect young trees against animals and the elements. We closed the bottoms of these tubes with thick pieces of cotton tissue to be able to use them as pots. The tubes were filled with a mixture of sand and vermiculite (1:1 volume ratio) up to a height of 115 cm. This substrate can be easily penetrated by the roots, and therefore allows each plant to reach its maximum rooting depth quickly. The tree shelter tubes were delivered in packages of five tubes stacked into each other, and they therefore came in five diameter classes (8.0, 8.4, 10.0, 10.8 and 12.0 cm). To avoid that tube diameter would be confounded with species identity, each of the five seedlings per species was planted in a different tube-diameter class. We placed the tubes upright in a randomized design in the Botanical Garden of the University of Konstanz (47∞41'24.0""N 9∞10'48.0""E; see Appendix S11 for pictures).</p>

<p>We planted 734 plants but, due to early mortality, we had to replace 126 of them within the next three weeks. The growth period therefore ranged from 16 to 19 weeks. The experiment took place during the summer of 2018 (mean temperature: 19.5∞C, min/max 2.5/37.4∞C; relative humidity: mean 74%, min/max 22.7/100%). All plants were fertilized once a week with 60 ml of a standard nutrient solution (1â Universol<sup>Æ </sup>Blue, Nordhorn, Germany), and watered regularly from above. We harvested the plants in October 2018. Each tube was sliced open, and we measured the distance from the top of the substrate to the deepest root.</p>

<h4><em>Traits from databases and data imputation</em></h4>

<p>Data on the aboveground traits specific leaf area (230 species) and height (228 species) were obtained from the LEDA database (Kleyer et al. 2008). Data on bud-bank size (230 species) including stem and root-derived buds occurring belowground or at the soil surface was obtained from Klimeöov· et al. (2017). In addition, mycorrhizal status was extracted from the FungalRoot database (Soudzilovskaia et al. 2020). We assigned the corresponding genus-level mycorrhizal status for each of our species (241 species) included in the analysis. Though most of our species are considered either obligatorily arbuscular-mycorrhizal (167 species), facultatively arbuscular-mycorrhizal (57 species) or non-mycorrhizal (16 species), <i>Helianthemum nummularium</i> is considered ectomycorrhizal. Therefore, it was grouped with the obligatorily arbuscular-mycorrhizal species to form the obligate-mycorrhizal category (168 species).</p>

<p>Although for each of the traits we had data for 196 (rooting depth) to 311 (seed weight) species, the number of species with complete data for all traits was 170. Therefore, we did phylogenetically informed imputation of missing data for the 241 species that germinated and survived until trait measurement in at least one of our two experiments. Data imputation is a powerful but still underutilized tool that increases sample size óand thus statistical poweró and reduces potential biases that might occur if the species with missing data are a non-random subset (Nakagawa 2015). Imputation can perform well with up to 50% of missing data (Graham 2009). In our case, 4.6% of the trait values were missing and had to be imputed (see Appendix S4 for details on the imputation procedure). We also ran all analyses for the subset of 170 species with complete data (i.e. without imputed data), and the results were largely similar to the analyses of the 241 species with partly imputed data (Appendix S9). Because the analyses with the imputed data allowed us to include more species (i.e. increase statistical power and generality), we present only those results in the main text. The phylogenetic tree of the species used, their standardized trait values and phylogenetic signal can be found in Appendix S5, S6 and S7.</p>

<h3>Species abundance and occurrence frequency</h3>

<p>To quantify each species' commonness from local scale abundance to global naturalization success, we used four different data sources.</p>

<h4><em>The Biodiversity Exploratories</em></h4>

<p>To obtain information on local abundance and occurrence frequency of our study species in German grasslands, we used data from the Biodiversity Exploratories grassland-composition surveys. In each of the three regions, c. 500 so-called grid plots (GPs) and a subset of those, the 50 so-called experimental plots (EPs), have been monitored for biodiversity measures. The plots are 50 m ◊ 50 m, and in each of those there is a subplot of 4 m ◊ 4 m, in which the relative abundance of each plant species has been determined. In the 1494 GPs, vegetation was sampled once from 25 May to 15 August 2007. In May 2009, 138 plots were re-assessed and earlier relevÈs were discarded, because they were considered unreliable as the vegetation had been recorded too late in the season of 2007 (Socher et al. 2013). Of our 241 study species, 213 were present in that census of the GPs (Appendix S1), and, when present in a plot, they covered on average 2.8% of the plot (min: 0.27%; median: 1.45%; max. 17.16%). For the 150 EPs, the vegetation data were collected annually between mid-May and mid-June from 2008 to 2016, and we averaged the data across years. Of our 241 study species, 239 were present in the EPs vegetation survey, and, when present in a plot, they covered on average 1.05% of the plot (min.: 0.01%; median: 0.34%; max.: 13.05%). Two study species, <i>Spergula arvensis</i> and <i>Taraxacum campylodes</i>, had been excluded because their names were included in an earlier version of the vegetation survey due to misidentification. While there are 10 times more GPs than EPs, the latter include data over a longer period. For both the GPs and EPs, we used two distribution metrics for each species: the occurrence frequency defined as the number of plots in which a species is present divided by the total number of plots, and the local abundance defined as the mean cover of a species across all the plots where it is present. Because it is based on the presence-absence only, the occurrence frequency estimates how frequent a species is within grasslands in Germany. The average abundance, on the other hand, which is calculated using abundance data for only those plots where the species occurs, estimates how dense the populations of the species are on average.</p>

<h4><em>FloraWeb</em></h4>

<p>For information on the occurrence frequency in all of Germany, irrespective of habitat type, we obtained data from the German plant distribution atlas of NetPhyD and BfN through the FloraWeb data portal (Bundesamt f¸r Naturschutz 2013). For each species, we extracted the number of grid cells in which the species has been reported. Each grid cell is about 130 km≤, and there are 2995 grid cells in total. Of our 241 study species, 235 had grid-cell data available (Appendix S1).</p>

<h4><em>Euro+Med PlantBase</em></h4>

<p>To obtain information on the extent of the native distribution in all of Europe and its adjacent Mediterranean regions, we used Euro+Med PlantBase (PESI 2015). This on-line database provides information on the presence of vascular plant taxa in 117 regions (mostly countries) covering all of Europe and the Mediterranean regions of North Africa and the Near East. Of our 241 study species, 237 species were found in Euro+Med PlantBase, and for those we extracted the total number of regions with native occurrences (Appendix S1). The four remaining species, <i>Cerastium nutans</i>, <i>Erigeron canadensis</i>, <i>Matricaria discoidea</i> and <i>Medicago ◊ varia</i>, are not native to the region.</p>

<h4><em>GloNAF</em></h4>

<p>As 237 of our 241 study species are native to Europe, we also assessed the extent of their global occurrence as naturalized alien species, using the Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF) database, version 1.2 (van Kleunen et al. 2019). GloNAF is a compendium of lists of naturalized alien plant species for 1029 regions covering &gt;80% of the terrestrial ice-free surface. Of our 241 study species, 221 species had at least one record in GloNAF. For those species, we extracted the number of regions in which they are naturalized, and for the 20 species without GloNAF records, we set the number of GloNAF regions equal to zero.</p>

<h3>Statistical analyses</h3>

<p>All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team 2019). To test whether more abundant and more widespread species have particular trait values, we used generalized linear models in which the response variables were the different measures of species commonness and the predictors were a selection of trait mean values. For number of occurrences in GloNAF regions, and in grassland GPs and EPs, we used negative binomial error distributions (with a log-link function). As the number of occurrences in FloraWeb grid cells and Euro+Med regions did not follow negative binomial or Poisson error distributions, we instead analysed the proportion of FloraWeb grid cells and Euro+Med regions in which a species had been recorded, with a binomial error distribution. To account for overdispersion, we used the 'quasibinomial' setting. For analyses of the mean local abundance (i.e. the cover proportion) of the species in the GPs and EPs, we used a gamma conditional distribution (with log-link function).</p>

<p>For each commonness measure, we used a multivariate model with ten traits as predictors. We <i>a priori</i> chose traits that represent different aspects of plant functioning and that had relatively low pairwise correlations (all r ? |0.49|, Appendix S3) to minimize multicolinearity (the maximum generalized variance-inflation factor of a model was 3.32). We used the following traits: individual seed weight (measured on seeds ordered for the experiments), specific root length, root tissue density and fine roots diameter (measured in the root-system morphology experiment), maximum rooting depth (measured in the rooting-depth experiment), and bud-bank size, height, specific leaf area and mycorrhizal status (from trait databases). Seed weight was log transformed. To facilitate interpretation of and comparison between model coefficients, each trait was scaled to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one (Schielzeth 2010). To test for potential non-linear effects of traits, orthogonal polynomial terms of second degree (i.e. quadratic terms) were also included for each trait, using the <i>poly</i> function. To estimate the proportion of variance explained by the models, we calculated delta R≤ values, applicable to all distributions and link functions, according to Nakagawa et al. (2017) using the package MuMIn (Barton and Barton 2015). To assess whether belowground traits explained more variance in commonness measures than aboveground traits, we also extracted delta R≤ values for models using only the three aboveground predictors and for models using only the three belowground predictors with the highest standardized coefficients. To account for phylogenetic non-independence of the study species, the models were also run using phylogenetic relatedness of species as a variance-covariance matrix (for details, see Appendix S4). Although the significances of the trait effects differed in some instances between the non-phylogenetic models and the phylogenetic ones, the directions of the effects were largely the same in both types of models (compare Fig. 1 and Appendix S8). Therefore, we only present the results of the non-phylogenetic analyses in the main text.</p>

<p>From the 15<sup>th</sup> of May to the 10<sup>th</sup> of October 2018, we performed an outdoor pot experiment to measure the maximum rooting depth of the species. Up to five seedlings of the species that had germinated (n=196; Appendix S1) were transplanted individually into 120 cm tall plastic tree shelter tubes (Tubex Æ Standard Plus, <a href=""http://www.tubex.com/products/tree-shelters/tubex-standard-treeshelters/specification.php"">http://www.tubex.com/products/tree-shelters/tubex-standard-treeshelters/specification.php</a>), which are normally used in forestry to protect young trees against animals and the elements.

The tree shelter tubes were delivered in packages of five tubes stacked into each other, and they therefore came in five diameter classes (8.0, 8.4, 10.0, 10.8 and 12.0 cm). To avoid that tube diameter would be confounded with species identity, each of the five seedlings per species was planted in a different tube-diameter class. We placed the tubes upright in a randomized design in the Botanical Garden of the University of Konstanz (47∞41'24.0""N 9∞10'48.0""E; see Appendix S11 for pictures).</p>

<p>We planted 734 plants but, due to early mortality, we had to replace 126 of them within the next three weeks. The growth period therefore ranged from 16 to 19 weeks. The experiment took place during the summer of 2018 (mean temperature: 19.5∞C, min/max 2.5/37.4∞C; relative humidity: mean 74%, min/max 22.7/100%). All plants were fertilized once a week with 60 ml of a standard nutrient solution (1â Universol<sup>Æ </sup>Blue, Nordhorn, Germany), and watered regularly from above. We harvested the plants in October 2018. Each tube was sliced open, and we measured the distance from the top of the substrate to the deepest root.</p>

<h4><em>Traits from databases and data imputation</em></h4>

<p>Data on the aboveground traits specific leaf area (230 species) and height (228 species) were obtained from the LEDA database (Kleyer et al. 2008). Data on bud-bank size (230 species) including stem and root-derived buds occurring belowground or at the soil surface was obtained from Klimeöov· et al. (2017). In addition, mycorrhizal status was extracted from the FungalRoot database (Soudzilovskaia et al. 2020). We assigned the corresponding genus-level mycorrhizal status for each of our species (241 species) included in the analysis. Though most of our species are considered either obligatorily arbuscular-mycorrhizal (167 species), facultatively arbuscular-mycorrhizal (57 species) or non-mycorrhizal (16 species), <i>Helianthemum nummularium</i> is considered ectomycorrhizal. Therefore, it was grouped with the obligatorily arbuscular-mycorrhizal species to form the obligate-mycorrhizal category (168 species).</p>

<p>Although for each of the traits we had data for 196 (rooting depth) to 311 (seed weight) species, the number of species with complete data for all traits was 170. Therefore, we did phylogenetically informed imputation of missing data for the 241 species that germinated and survived until trait measurement in at least one of our two experiments. Data imputation is a powerful but still underutilized tool that increases sample size óand thus statistical poweró and reduces potential biases that might occur if the species with missing data are a non-random subset (Nakagawa 2015). Imputation can perform well with up to 50% of missing data (Graham 2009). In our case, 4.6% of the trait values were missing and had to be imputed (see Appendix S4 for details on the imputation procedure). We also ran all analyses for the subset of 170 species with complete data (i.e. without imputed data), and the results were largely similar to the analyses of the 241 species with partly imputed data (Appendix S9). Because the analyses with the imputed data allowed us to include more species (i.e. increase statistical power and generality), we present only those results in the main text. The phylogenetic tree of the species used, their standardized trait values and phylogenetic signal can be found in Appendix S5, S6 and S7.</p>

<h3>Species abundance and occurrence frequency</h3>

<p>To quantify each species' commonness from local scale abundance to global naturalization success, we used four different data sources.</p>

<h4><em>The Biodiversity Exploratories</em></h4>

<p>To obtain information on local abundance and occurrence frequency of our study species in German grasslands, we used data from the Biodiversity Exploratories grassland-composition surveys. In each of the three regions, c. 500 so-called grid plots (GPs) and a subset of those, the 50 so-called experimental plots (EPs), have been monitored for biodiversity measures. The plots are 50 m ◊ 50 m, and in each of those there is a subplot of 4 m ◊ 4 m, in which the relative abundance of each plant species has been determined. In the 1494 GPs, vegetation was sampled once from 25 May to 15 August 2007. In May 2009, 138 plots were re-assessed and earlier relevÈs were discarded, because they were considered unreliable as the vegetation had been recorded too late in the season of 2007 (Socher et al. 2013). Of our 241 study species, 213 were present in that census of the GPs (Appendix S1), and, when present in a plot, they covered on average 2.8% of the plot (min: 0.27%; median: 1.45%; max. 17.16%). For the 150 EPs, the vegetation data were collected annually between mid-May and mid-June from 2008 to 2016, and we averaged the data across years. Of our 241 study species, 239 were present in the EPs vegetation survey, and, when present in a plot, they covered on average 1.05% of the plot (min.: 0.01%; median: 0.34%; max.: 13.05%). Two study species, <i>Spergula arvensis</i> and <i>Taraxacum campylodes</i>, had been excluded because their names were included in an earlier version of the vegetation survey due to misidentification. While there are 10 times more GPs than EPs, the latter include data over a longer period. For both the GPs and EPs, we used two distribution metrics for each species: the occurrence frequency defined as the number of plots in which a species is present divided by the total number of plots, and the local abundance defined as the mean cover of a species across all the plots where it is present. Because it is based on the presence-absence only, the occurrence frequency estimates how frequent a species is within grasslands in Germany. The average abundance, on the other hand, which is calculated using abundance data for only those plots where the species occurs, estimates how dense the populations of the species are on average.</p>

<h4><em>FloraWeb</em></h4>

<p>For information on the occurrence frequency in all of Germany, irrespective of habitat type, we obtained data from the German plant distribution atlas of NetPhyD and BfN through the FloraWeb data portal (Bundesamt f¸r Naturschutz 2013). For each species, we extracted the number of grid cells in which the species has been reported. Each grid cell is about 130 km≤, and there are 2995 grid cells in total. Of our 241 study species, 235 had grid-cell data available (Appendix S1).</p>

<h4><em>Euro+Med PlantBase</em></h4>

<p>To obtain information on the extent of the native distribution in all of Europe and its adjacent Mediterranean regions, we used Euro+Med PlantBase (PESI 2015). This on-line database provides information on the presence of vascular plant taxa in 117 regions (mostly countries) covering all of Europe and the Mediterranean regions of North Africa and the Near East. Of our 241 study species, 237 species were found in Euro+Med PlantBase, and for those we extracted the total number of regions with native occurrences (Appendix S1). The four remaining species, <i>Cerastium nutans</i>, <i>Erigeron canadensis</i>, <i>Matricaria discoidea</i> and <i>Medicago ◊ varia</i>, are not native to the region.</p>

<h4><em>GloNAF</em></h4>

<p>As 237 of our 241 study species are native to Europe, we also assessed the extent of their global occurrence as naturalized alien species, using the Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF) database, version 1.2 (van Kleunen et al. 2019). GloNAF is a compendium of lists of naturalized alien plant species for 1029 regions covering &gt;80% of the terrestrial ice-free surface. Of our 241 study species, 221 species had at least one record in GloNAF. For those species, we extracted the number of regions in which they are naturalized, and for the 20 species without GloNAF records, we set the number of GloNAF regions equal to zero.</p>

<h3>Statistical analyses</h3>

<p>All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team 2019). To test whether more abundant and more widespread species have particular trait values, we used generalized linear models in which the response variables were the different measures of species commonness and the predictors were a selection of trait mean values. For number of occurrences in GloNAF regions, and in grassland GPs and EPs, we used negative binomial error distributions (with a log-link function). As the number of occurrences in FloraWeb grid cells and Euro+Med regions did not follow negative binomial or Poisson error distributions, we instead analysed the proportion of FloraWeb grid cells and Euro+Med regions in which a species had been recorded, with a binomial error distribution. To account for overdispersion, we used the 'quasibinomial' setting. For analyses of the mean local abundance (i.e. the cover proportion) of the species in the GPs and EPs, we used a gamma conditional distribution (with log-link function).</p>

<p>For each commonness measure, we used a multivariate model with ten traits as predictors. We <i>a priori</i> chose traits that represent different aspects of plant functioning and that had relatively low pairwise correlations (all r ? |0.49|, Appendix S3) to minimize multicolinearity (the maximum generalized variance-inflation factor of a model was 3.32). We used the following traits: individual seed weight (measured on seeds ordered for the experiments), specific root length, root tissue density and fine roots diameter (measured in the root-system morphology experiment), maximum rooting depth (measured in the rooting-depth experiment), and bud-bank size, height, specific leaf area and mycorrhizal status (from trait databases). Seed weight was log transformed. To facilitate interpretation of and comparison between model coefficients, each trait was scaled to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one (Schielzeth 2010). To test for potential non-linear effects of traits, orthogonal polynomial terms of second degree (i.e. quadratic terms) were also included for each trait, using the <i>poly</i> function. To estimate the proportion of variance explained by the models, we calculated delta R≤ values, applicable to all distributions and link functions, according to Nakagawa et al. (2017) using the package MuMIn (Barton and Barton 2015). To assess whether belowground traits explained more variance in commonness measures than aboveground traits, we also extracted delta R≤ values for models using only the three aboveground predictors and for models using only the three belowground predictors with the highest standardized coefficients. To account for phylogenetic non-independence of the study species, the models were also run using phylogenetic relatedness of species as a variance-covariance matrix (for details, see Appendix S4). Although the significances of the trait effects differed in some instances between the non-phylogenetic models and the phylogenetic ones, the directions of the effects were largely the same in both types of models (compare Fig. 1 and Appendix S8). Therefore, we only present the results of the non-phylogenetic analyses in the main text.</p>

Plants vary widely in how common or rare they are, but whether commonness of species is associated with functional traits is still debated. This might partly be because commonness can be measured at different spatial scales, and because most studies focus solely on aboveground functional traits.</p>

<p>2. We measured five root traits and seed mass on 241 Central European grassland species, and extracted their specific leaf area, height, mycorrhizal status and bud-bank size from databases. Then we tested if trait values are associated with commonness at seven spatial scales, ranging from abundance in 16-m≤ grassland plots, via regional and European-wide occurrence frequencies, to worldwide naturalization success.</p>

<p>3. At every spatial scale, commonness was associated with at least three traits. The traits explained the greatest proportions of variance for abundance in grassland plots (42%) and naturalization success (41%), and the least for occurrence frequencies in Europe and the Mediterranean (2%). Low root tissue density characterized common species at every scale, whereas other traits showed directional changes depending on the scale. We also found that many of the effects had significant non-linear effects, in most cases with the highest commonness-metric value at intermediate trait values. Across scales, belowground traits explained overall more variance in species commonness (19.4%) than aboveground traits (12.6%).</p>

<p>4. The changes we found in the relationships between traits and commonness, when going from one spatial scale to another, could at least partly explain the maintenance of trait variation in nature. Most importantly, our study shows that within grasslands, belowground traits are at least as important as aboveground traits for species commonness. Therefore, belowground traits should be more frequently considered in studies on plant functional ecology.</p> <p>Please find complementarity information about the dataset in the Supplementary Information of the corresponding article.</p>

Interactions between drought and insect defoliation may dramatically alter forest function under novel climate and disturbance regimes, but remain poorly understood.

<p>The files collected here relate to a study being submitted to the American Geophysical Union's journal, Earth's Future. The title of the paper being submitted is, ""The contribution of Microrefugia to landscape thermal inertia for climate-adaptive conservation and adaptation strategies.""</p>
<p>The study was conducted across 40,250 km<sup>2</sup> of complex mountainous terrain in Northern California. The objective of the study was to consider whether it was possible to identify the relative strength of microrefugia systematically in order to provide conservation and climate-adaptation strategies with information that could help with prioritizing actions. We selected an operational scale of 10 ha (25 acres) as a scale that is suitable for various types of landscape planning exercises, and created a hexagon grid for the region. We calculated the mean value for multiple variables and appended them into the hexagons. For thermal inertia, we calculated the mean elevation per hexagon and then its coolest (highest) point using an environmental lapse rate. We also calculated solar energy loading, calculated the mean solar load per hexagon, and calculated its effect on air temperature. We combined these two temperature metrics to identify how much thermal buffering capacity each hexagon contains, as measured by how much warming it could experience before the mean temperature, as determined from a baseline time period, is no longer found anywhere within the hexagon. We tied the mean annual temperature from 1981ñ2010 to the mean elevation in each hexagon, as well as a temperature from an earlier period, and from several future periods, based on global circulation models.</p>
<p>The study shows how long current (baseline) climate conditions found in each hexagon may persist and shows how the resulting map of landscape thermal inertia can be used when considering natural vegetation types for conservation, identifying which parts of high-priority wildlife corridors have the greatest capacity to retain their current climate conditions, and what the potential for retaining baseline climate conditions is for areas with late-seral forest conditions as represented by forest canopy height.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>a.† How we processed material into the hexagon framework</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We created a geodatabase of 10 ha hexagons for the region in order to summarize the spatial data in this study into spatial units that are comparable across the region but that also represent an area size that is relevant for site-level plans such as landscape connectivity or forest conservation.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The hexagon geodatabase covers 28,269 km<sup>2</sup> in within the 5 watersheds in northern California, and 40,895 km<sup>2</sup> in the 5 watersheds plus a 10 km buffer area.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Integrating data into the hexes</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Data from a variety of grid scales, including 10, 30, 90, and 270m was added using the ArcGIS sample tool with the Hexagon centroids to sample the 270m resolution data, and the zonal statistics tool within Hexagon boundaries for raster data with smaller grid cell sizes.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">†</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This study used four types of data (Table 1):</p>
<ul>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Air temperature &amp; topographic ñ Topographic data was used to calculate microrefugia buffering capacity for each hexagon. Temperature data was used to evaluate the effect of historical and projected future warming on the ability of local sites to retain baseline temperature conditions.</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Habitats / Dominant Vegetation Types ñ Habitat data was used to profile the presence and extent of microrefugia by habitat type for the region</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Landscape Connectivity Models ñ were used to find microrefugia in areas that are highly ranked for landscape connectivity</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Forest Structure data ñ was used to identify where large, late seral trees occupy microrefugia sites.</li>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong><u>Microrefugia ñ thermal buffering capacity</u></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Thermal buffering capacity combined two metrics that represent potential modifications to the air temperature in each 10-ha hexagon. First, a 10m digital elevation model was used to calculate the variation in air temperature within each hexagon due to variations in elevation, using a standard environmental lapse rate. Second, the influence of solar radiation on air temperature was calculated. These two metrics were combined.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Elevational Effect on Air Temperature ††Column: ElevLR_NegEff2</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Zonal Statistics was performed on a 10m DEM for each hex. The range of elevation was used with environmental lapse rate to calculate ""buffering capacity"" within each Hexagon. We used an environmental lapse rate of 0.00649606 C?/ meter (International Civil Aviation Organization, 1993) to calculate the range of temperatures within the hexagon. To calculate the effect of elevation on air temperature within each hexagon we used the following equation: (Average Elevation ñ Maximum Elevation) x 0.00649606</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">†</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Solar Radiation Effect on Air Temperature: ñ Column: SRtemp_min</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We ran the analysis on a 25 m-resolution DEM. We calculated annualized solar radiation via the r.sun model available in GRASS 7.8 (https://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/r.sun.html) which calculates direct, diffuse, and reflected solar irradiation for a given day, location, topography, and atmospheric conditions. We assumed clear-sky conditions to run this model, and ran the model for 2 days in each month, from which we calculated solar radiation as a yearly total in watt-hours/m<sup>2</sup>. We converted the output to megajoules as follows.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">We used a regionally calibrated conversion factor to determine air temperature from Watts/M<sup>2</sup>/time from a study in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Curtis et al.; Flint et al. 2021), who determined the relationship of solar radiation with air temperature by using snowmelt and air temperature measurements in the field, which were then used to calibrate a solar radiation model for topographically diverse locations (Flint and Childs, 1987). The best fit resulted in an increase of 0.25 C for every 2.5 MJ/day of solar radiation above 7.5 MJ/day (Table below). Zonal Statistics was performed for each hexagon and the minimum value of solar radiation-driven air temperature was retained.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>a.† How we processed material into the hexagon framework</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We created a geodatabase of 10 ha hexagons for the region in order to summarize the spatial data in this study into spatial units that are comparable across the region but that also represent an area size that is relevant for site-level plans such as landscape connectivity or forest conservation.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The hexagon geodatabase covers 28,269 km<sup>2</sup> in within the 5 watersheds in northern California, and 40,895 km<sup>2</sup> in the 5 watersheds plus a 10 km buffer area.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Integrating data into the hexes</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Data from a variety of grid scales, including 10, 30, 90, and 270m was added using the ArcGIS sample tool with the Hexagon centroids to sample the 270m resolution data, and the zonal statistics tool within Hexagon boundaries for raster data with smaller grid cell sizes.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">†</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This study used four types of data (Table 1):</p>
<ul>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Air temperature &amp; topographic ñ Topographic data was used to calculate microrefugia buffering capacity for each hexagon. Temperature data was used to evaluate the effect of historical and projected future warming on the ability of local sites to retain baseline temperature conditions.</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Habitats / Dominant Vegetation Types ñ Habitat data was used to profile the presence and extent of microrefugia by habitat type for the region</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Landscape Connectivity Models ñ were used to find microrefugia in areas that are highly ranked for landscape connectivity</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">Forest Structure data ñ was used to identify where large, late seral trees occupy microrefugia sites.</li>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong><u>Microrefugia ñ thermal buffering capacity</u></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Thermal buffering capacity combined two metrics that represent potential modifications to the air temperature in each 10-ha hexagon. First, a 10m digital elevation model was used to calculate the variation in air temperature within each hexagon due to variations in elevation, using a standard environmental lapse rate. Second, the influence of solar radiation on air temperature was calculated. These two metrics were combined.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Elevational Effect on Air Temperature ††Column: ElevLR_NegEff2</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Zonal Statistics was performed on a 10m DEM for each hex. The range of elevation was used with environmental lapse rate to calculate ""buffering capacity"" within each Hexagon. We used an environmental lapse rate of 0.00649606 C?/ meter (International Civil Aviation Organization, 1993) to calculate the range of temperatures within the hexagon. To calculate the effect of elevation on air temperature within each hexagon we used the following equation: (Average Elevation ñ Maximum Elevation) x 0.00649606</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">†</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Solar Radiation Effect on Air Temperature: ñ Column: SRtemp_min</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We ran the analysis on a 25 m-resolution DEM. We calculated annualized solar radiation via the r.sun model available in GRASS 7.8 (https://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/r.sun.html) which calculates direct, diffuse, and reflected solar irradiation for a given day, location, topography, and atmospheric conditions. We assumed clear-sky conditions to run this model, and ran the model for 2 days in each month, from which we calculated solar radiation as a yearly total in watt-hours/m<sup>2</sup>. We converted the output to megajoules as follows.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">We used a regionally calibrated conversion factor to determine air temperature from Watts/M<sup>2</sup>/time from a study in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Curtis et al.; Flint et al. 2021), who determined the relationship of solar radiation with air temperature by using snowmelt and air temperature measurements in the field, which were then used to calibrate a solar radiation model for topographically diverse locations (Flint and Childs, 1987). The best fit resulted in an increase of 0.25 C for every 2.5 MJ/day of solar radiation above 7.5 MJ/day (Table below). Zonal Statistics was performed for each hexagon and the minimum value of solar radiation-driven air temperature was retained.</p>

Mast seeding is perhaps the most common type of resource pulse that occurs in terrestrial ecosystems, is characterized by the synchronous and highly variable production of seed crops by a population of perennial plants, is widespread both taxonomically and geographically, and is often associated with nutrient scarcity. The rare production of abundant seed crops (mast events) that are orders of magnitude greater than crops during low seed years leads to high reproductive success in seed consumers and has cascading impacts in ecosystems. Although it has been suggested that mast seeding is potentially synchronized at continental scales, studies are largely constrained to local areas covering tens to hundreds of kilometres. Furthermore, summer temperature, which acts as a cue for mast seeding, shows patterns at continental scales manifested as a juxtaposition of positive and negative anomalies that have been linked to irruptive movements of boreal seed-eating birds. Here, we show a breakdown in synchrony of mast seeding patterns across space, leading to asynchrony at the continental scale.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.tqjq2bvwz,A 249-year chronosequence of forest plots from eight successive fires in the eastern Canada boreal mixedwoods,"<p>A combination of wildfires and defoliating insect outbreaks play an important role in the natural successional dynamics of North American boreal forests, which, in the long term, change the post-disturbance composition and structure of forest stands. After stand-replacing disturbances (mainly wildfires), early successional hardwoods typically dominate the affected areas in boreal forests. Provided sufficient time following disturbances, the increasing recruitment of mid- to late-successional softwoods as well as the mortality of hardwoods gradually change forest composition from hardwoods to admixtures of hardwood-conifer species and conifer-dominated stands in mid and late successional stages, respectively. Such mixed woods are abundant across the southern Canadian boreal forest. In boreal Canada, mixed woods are the most structurally heterogeneous forest ecosystems, are highly productive, and form an important source of timber supply. Here we present the EASTERN BOREAL MIXEDWOODS CANADA dataset, which documents the changes in composition and structure of stands originating from eight successive wildfires representing a chronosequence of 249 years in eastern Canada. This dataset has been used in several different projects to study and model the influence of natural (e.g., insect outbreaks) and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., harvesting) on the dynamics of post-fire stands. The data covers a high range of variability in stand composition and structure, explained by species establishment, dominance and mixture. It thus constitutes a useful source of information to trace the dynamics of the main boreal tree species of eastern north America, from their establishment to their replacement at different spatial scales (e.g., from stand to landscape level).</p>","<p><em>Note: Detailed methods will be described in forthcoming data paper.</em></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;margin-bottom:11px;"">The dataset integrates data from inventories conducted during 1990-2019 period throughout the Lake Duparquet Research and Teaching Forest (LDRTF), located in the balsam fir - white birch bioclimatic domain of QuÈbec (Canada), where a dozen of large wildfires occurred since 1760 (Bergeron 1991). Within the LDRTF site, the EASTERN BOREAL MIXEDWOODS CANADA data have been collected in three main subsets that cover different study objectives that contribute to a better understanding of post-fire stand successional dynamics:</p>

<ol>
	<li style=""text-align:justify;"">
<u>†LDRTF-TRANSECTS:</u> These transects represent a network of 596 quadrats that covers the stands originated from eight wildfires that occurred from 1760 to 1964 (1760, 1797, 1823, 1847, 1870, 1916, 1944 and 1964). The original idea of establishing the quadrats in 1990-1991 was to study the compositional and structural variability of post-fire stands and changes over time, first with a chronosequence analysis (Bergeron and Dubuc 1989) and then by a stand-reconstruction approach (Bergeron 2000). The other objective of establishing the plots were to study the interaction between post fire stand composition and secondary disturbances (Kneeshaw and Bergeron 1998). The quadrats were re-sampled in 2009 and were used in several studies, for example for parametrizing the SORTIE-ND forest simulator to simulate the natural successional dynamics of post-fire stands in LDRTF over long periods, both in presence and in absence of natural and anthropogenic disturbances (Poulin et al. 2007, Poulin and Messier 2008, Leduc and Coates 2013, Bose et al. 2015, Maleki et al. 2020).</li>
	<li style=""text-align:justify;margin-bottom:11px;"">
<u>LDRTF-SEEDLING_PLOTS:</u> In each post-fire stand (1760, 1797, 1823, 1847, 1870, 1916, 1944 and 1964) a 400 m<sup>2</sup> plot was stablished in 1997 to observe annual seedling recruitment and mortality in 16 one-m<sup>2</sup> subplots located near the plot borders.</li>
	<li style=""text-align:justify;margin-bottom:11px;"">
<u>LDRTF-HECTARES:</u> In six of the post-fire stands (1760, 1823, 1847, 1870, 1916 and 1944) a one-hectare permanent plot was first established in 1991 and re-measured in 4-6 years intervals. One of the goals to establish this data was to study the spatial patterns, age structure and growth of species in each stand (Park et al. 2005).</li>

The original idea of establishing the quadrats in 1990-1991 was to study the compositional and structural variability of post-fire stands and changes over time, first with a chronosequence analysis (Bergeron and Dubuc 1989) and then by a stand-reconstruction approach (Bergeron 2000). The other objective of establishing the plots were to study the interaction between post fire stand composition and secondary disturbances (Kneeshaw and Bergeron 1998). The quadrats were re-sampled in 2009 and were used in several studies, for example for parametrizing the SORTIE-ND forest simulator to simulate the natural successional dynamics of post-fire stands in LDRTF over long periods, both in presence and in absence of natural and anthropogenic disturbances (Poulin et al. 2007, Poulin and Messier 2008, Leduc and Coates 2013, Bose et al. 2015, Maleki et al. 2020).</li>

<u>LDRTF-SEEDLING_PLOTS:</u> In each post-fire stand (1760, 1797, 1823, 1847, 1870, 1916, 1944 and 1964) a 400 m<sup>2</sup> plot was stablished in 1997 to observe annual seedling recruitment and mortality in 16 one-m<sup>2</sup> subplots located near the plot borders.</li>
	<li style=""text-align:justify;margin-bottom:11px;"">
<u>LDRTF-HECTARES:</u> In six of the post-fire stands (1760, 1823, 1847, 1870, 1916 and 1944) a one-hectare permanent plot was first established in 1991 and re-measured in 4-6 years intervals. One of the goals to establish this data was to study the spatial patterns, age structure and growth of species in each stand (Park et al. 2005).</li>
</ol> <p>A combination of wildfires and defoliating insect outbreaks play an important role in the natural successional dynamics of North American boreal forests, which, in the long term, change the post-disturbance composition and structure of forest stands. After stand-replacing disturbances (mainly wildfires), early successional hardwoods typically dominate the affected areas in boreal forests. Provided sufficient time following disturbances, the increasing recruitment of mid- to late-successional softwoods as well as the mortality of hardwoods gradually change forest composition from hardwoods to admixtures of hardwood-conifer species and conifer-dominated stands in mid and late successional stages, respectively. Such mixed woods are abundant across the southern Canadian boreal forest. In boreal Canada, mixed woods are the most structurally heterogeneous forest ecosystems, are highly productive, and form an important source of timber supply. Here we present the EASTERN BOREAL MIXEDWOODS CANADA dataset, which documents the changes in composition and structure of stands originating from eight successive wildfires representing a chronosequence of 249 years in eastern Canada. This dataset has been used in several different projects to study and model the influence of natural (e.g., insect outbreaks) and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., harvesting) on the dynamics of post-fire stands. The data covers a high range of variability in stand composition and structure, explained by species establishment, dominance and mixture. It thus constitutes a useful source of information to trace the dynamics of the main boreal tree species of eastern north America, from their establishment to their replacement at different spatial scales (e.g., from stand to landscape level).</p> <p>The README.txt file contains the description of all tables and variables in the data.</p>

<p>The first version of a U.S.-EPA-BELD4-equivalent landuse database for Canada was compiled in 2018 by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) based on: (1) the first version of Canada-wide tree species composition maps based on the 2001 Canadian National Forest Inventory (NFI; Beaudoin et al., 2014); (2) the 2016 Canadian Annual Crop Inventory (ACI); and (3) the Land Cover Classification System surface hydrology (LCCS3) data set contained in the Collection 6 MODIS Land Cover product MCD12Q1 (Zhang and Moran, 2018).&nbsp; Recently, an improved mapping approach for estimating forest attributes from MODIS imagery was applied to reprocess the 2001 NFI-based species composition maps and to create a new set of species composition maps for 2011 using 2011 MODIS imagery (Beaudoin et al., 2017a,b).&nbsp; The new mapping approach resulted in an improved set of 2001 species composition maps as indicated by increased correlation coefficients and decreased mean deviations (MD) and root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) between 35,305 MODIS reference pixels for 2001 and the 2001 NFI photo-plot product (Beaudoin et al., 2017b). &nbsp;In addition, for the new 2011 species composition maps, expected reductions in forest coverage were seen for areas of Canada that had experienced rapid development between 2001 and 2011, such as the Athabasca Oil Sands (AOS) area in northeastern Alberta and areas near major urban centres such as Toronto and Vancouver.&nbsp; Given the improved mapping approach and the greater recentness of the 2011 tree species composition maps, the Canadian BELD4 landuse database was updated using these new 2011 maps and the same methodology described in Zhang and Moran (2018).&nbsp; Note that no change was made to the ACI and MODIS Land Cover product data sets that were used to develop this new database version.</p>

<p>Because the number of tree species considered in the 2001 NFI-based forest composition maps was reduced from 109 in the first version to 75 in the second version due to the least abundant tree species being lumped with other related species (Beaudoin et al., 2017b), gridded fractional-coverage fields for the U.S.-EPA-BELD4-equivalent landuse categories compiled for Canada have also been reduced, from 92 in the first version of the Canadian BELD4 database to 80 in this second version.&nbsp; The mapping from the 75 NFI tree species to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) BELD4 landuse categories is shown in the attached spreadsheet &ldquo;ACI_NFI_BELD4_species_match_V2.xlsx&rdquo;, along with the unchanged mapping of 62 ACI species and other landuse categories.&nbsp; The mapping used to link the LCCS3 categories to the BELD4 categories also remains unchanged and is described in the attached Excel file &ldquo;MODIS_LCCS3_BELD4_mapping.xlsx&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The updated version 2 of the Canadian BELD4 landuse database is provided here in GeoTIFF format at 1-km resolution for a Lambert conformal conic projection (+proj=lcc +lat_1=49 +lat_2=77 +lat_0=0 +lon_0=-95 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs) in the compressed file &ldquo;CAN-BELD4_tif_V2.7z&rdquo;.&nbsp; Note that to use this dataset in conjunction with the U.S. EPA BELD4 database (<a href=""https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-modeling/biogenic-emission-sources"">https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-modeling/biogenic-emission-sources</a>), all MODIS landuse categories in the original EPA BELD4 database must be removed for Canada to avoid double-counting.&nbsp; Plots of the 80 matched Canadian and U.S.&nbsp; BELD4 vegetation species and other landuse categories in the new Canadian BELD4 database are shown in the attached file &ldquo;CAN_US_Matched_BELD4_Species_Plots_V2.pdf&rdquo;. &nbsp;Lastly, an overview and description of the updated Canadian BELD4 landuse database was presented at a recent conference (Zhang et al., 2019, <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-08/documents/800am_zhang_2_0.pdf"">https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-08/documents/800am_zhang_2_0.pdf</a>); this presentation is also provided in this package as file &ldquo;2019EI_Updated_BELD4_Impact_on_VOC_emissions.pptx&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

Ash trees (<em>Fraxinus</em>†spp.) can be abundant in these forests. However, invasion by the emerald ash borer (<em>Agrilus planipennis†</em>Fairmaire) in North America threatens their survival. The disappearance of ash will have a large impact on the riparian forest composition in itself. It is not known what the consequences would be for the remaining forest if ash plays an important role in the beaver diet. Inventory plots across a ash gradient were measured in Plaisance National Park, Quebec, Canada, to collect data and to establish if (1) trees and saplings of this genus were selected or avoided by beavers, (2) if other genera had a lower or a greater probability of being consumed compared to ash, and (3) if ash density could affect the probability of consumption of other genera. Of all genera present in the park, ash trees were selected in the highest number of plots. Only two genera,†<em>Carpinus</em>†and†<em>Populus</em>, had a higher probability of being consumed than ash. These genera are not abundant in the park, and neither in riparian forests of the temperate biome, and thus are not good candidates to replace ash as a staple for beavers. The most abundant genus in riparian temperate forests, along with ash, is†<em>Acer</em>. In this study,†<em>Acer</em>†trees were not selected, and as for†<em>Acer</em> saplings, were less likely to be consumed than ash. Mixed results were obtained about genera that could become more likely to be consumed as ash density decreases. It would seem that the disappearance of ash would not cause a switch to a single or a few genera in the future, which may be due to the high diversity of genera present in temperate riparian forests. However, ash may not disappear completely due to its capacity to sprout following the death of the aboveground portion of ash trees. This scenario is discussed in light of the susceptibility of intermediate-sized ash stems to be colonized by the emerald ash borer and of the greater likelihood of beavers to feed on these same-sized stems.</p>","<p>This data has been collected on 24 plots in Plaisance National Park, Quebec, Canada.

This scenario is discussed in light of the susceptibility of intermediate-sized ash stems to be colonized by the emerald ash borer and of the greater likelihood of beavers to feed on these same-sized stems.</p> <p>All the analyses described in our manuscript have been realized with R software 4.1.0</p><p>Funding provided by: Mitacs<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004489<br>Award Number: IT10755</p><p>Funding provided by: S…PAQ*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p> Castor canadensis; Fraxinus spp; emerald ash borer; Feeding behavior; Riparian forests; Temperate biome ",1,0,NA,yes,L,repository,.xlsx,site IDs,no,administrative unit,"Castor canadensis, Agrilus planipennis, c.30 plant species",2019,source publication text,<1,NA,28,source publication text,presence-only,,,,Forests,,,data are just measurements on species in different plots in the study area

We posit that anatomical traits in roots can provide insight on the overall organization of the root system.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8cz8w9gnc,Data from: Microbiomes of a specialist caterpillar are consistent across different habitats but also resemble the local soil microbial communities,"<p><b>Background</b>: Insect-associated microorganisms can provide a wide range of benefits to their host, but insect dependency on these microbes varies greatly. The origin and functionality of insect microbiomes is not well understood. Many caterpillars can harbor symbionts in their gut that impact host metabolism, nutrient uptake and pathogen protection. Despite our lack of knowledge on the ecological factors driving microbiome assemblages of wild caterpillars, they seem to be highly variable and influenced by diet and environment. Several recent studies have shown that shoot-feeding caterpillars acquire part of their microbiome from the soil. Here, we examine microbiomes of a monophagous caterpillar (<i>Tyria jacobaeae</i>) collected from its natural host plant (<i>Jacobaeae vulgaris</i>) growing in three different environments: coastal dunes, natural inland grasslands and riverine grasslands, and compare the bacterial communities of the wild caterpillars to those of soil samples collected from underneath each of the host plants from which the caterpillars were collected.</p>

<p><b>Results</b>: The microbiomes of the caterpillars were dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Only 5% of the total bacterial diversity represented 86.2% of the total caterpillar's microbiome. Interestingly, we found a high consistency of dominant bacteria within the family Burkholderiaceae in all caterpillar samples across the three habitats. There was one amplicon sequence variant belonging to the genus <i>Ralstonia</i> that represented on average 53% of total community composition across all caterpillars. On average, one quarter of the caterpillar microbiome was shared with the soil.</p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b>: We found that the monophagous caterpillars collected from fields located more than 100 kilometers apart were all dominated by a single <i>Ralstonia</i>. The remainder of the bacterial communities that were present resembled the local microbial communities in the soil in which the host plant was growing. Our findings provide an example of a caterpillar that has just a few key associated bacteria, but that also contains a community of low abundant bacteria characteristic of soil communities.</p>","<h3 style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Study sites and sample collection</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">We selected three characteristic habitats in The Netherlands in which ragwort plants and cinnabar moths occur in their native range: coastal dunes (Meijendel), inland natural grasslands (Veluwe) and riverine grasslands (Wageningen) and sampled in three localities within each habitat. At each locality, ten <i>Jacobaeae vulgaris </i>plants on which <i>Tyria jacobaeae</i> caterpillars were feeding were selected (<span>SI Figure S1</span>). Plants were located at a distance of at least 10 m to each other (except for two sampling localities in riverine grasslands where the smallest distance between two plants was 8.3 and 9.2 m). Around the stem of each plant, five soil samples from the top 5 cm layer were taken using a 20 cm soil borer with 2 cm diameter and pooled together. Caterpillars collected from each individual plant were kept together (with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 10 caterpillars collected per plant). All samples were stored in a cooler with ice until processing in the laboratory on the same day. Fresh weight of each individual caterpillar was recorded (<span>SI Figure S2</span>; <span>SI Table S1</span>). All caterpillars were surface sterilized by dipping them for 30 seconds in the following solutions: 70% ethanol, 2.0% bleach, and then rinsed twice with autoclaved demineralized water. Caterpillars were surface sterilized to enrich the samples for gut rather than surface microbes while leaving gut microbes intact [20]. Both caterpillar and soil samples were stored at -20 ∞C until further processing. Caterpillar samples were lyophilized prior to DNA extractions.†</p>

<h3 style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">DNA extraction and library preparation</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">To obtain a representative sample of caterpillars feeding on one plant, DNA was extracted collectively from three homogenized caterpillars, from approximately 10 mg of dry, lyophilized sample. In total, 270 caterpillars were used in this study (9 study locations x 10 plants x 3 caterpillars per sample). Extractions were performed using the MP Biomedicals FastDNAô Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol with the following modifications. Samples homogenized with Cell Lysis Solution in the FastPrepÆ Instrument (MP Biomedicals) for 20 seconds (speed setting of 6.0) were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. An extra washing step was included, and the final eluted DNA was additionally precipitated prior further purification using standard ethanol precipitation method with potassium acetate.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">From approximately 0.35 g of soil samples, DNA was extracted from 90 samples using DNeasy PowerSoil Kit DNA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Approximately 10 ng of template DNA was used for PCR using primers 515FB [21] and 806RB [22] targeting the V4 habitat of the 16S rRNA gene [23]. The PCR mixture (25 µl) contained 12.5 µl Phusion Flash High Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific), 1.25 µl of each of the primers (10 µM). The conditions were 45 s at 98 ∞C, followed by 30 cycles for caterpillars and 25 for soil samples of 98 ∞C for 5 s, 55 ∞C for 5 s, and 72 ∞C for 10 s with a final extension of 1 min at 72 ∞C. The PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Adapters and barcodes were added to samples using Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit sets A-B (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The final PCR product was purified again with AMPure beads, verified using agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Hudson, NH, USA) before equimolar pooling. Separate libraries were prepared for bacterial communities derived from caterpillar and soil samples (96 samples per library) including extraction negatives. Libraries were sequenced at McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Center.</p>

<h3 style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Sequence processing</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Raw reads were processed into ASVs (amplicon sequence variants) using the DADA2 pipeline [24], and taxonomic identification was performed by querying against the SILVA database with SINA classifier [25]. Reads that could not be assigned to Bacteria (i.e. Archaea, Eukaryotes, mitochondria, chloroplast, and unidentified) and all the bacterial ASVs present in the extraction negatives were excluded. The percentage of mitochondria and chloroplast reads was variable between samples, as it is often reported in insect gut microbiome studies [26], but did not significantly differ between localities or regions (SI Figure S2). Caterpillar and soil datasets were filtered separately due to their inherent differences in bacterial diversity. Only samples with sequencing depth ranging from five times more to five times less than the mean sequencing depth of caterpillar or soil samples were kept for further analysis. To explore general patterns of bacterial diversity among samples, the caterpillar and soil datasets were resampled to the lowest sequencing depth of 3,849 and 13,731 reads, respectively. This resulted in removing three caterpillar samples (one from each habitat); while all soil samples were kept. The combined rarefied datasets resulted in 1,570,653 reads assigned to 41,089 bacterial ASVs, of which 11,685 ASVs were present in high abundance (&gt;0.1% relative abundance).</p>

<h3 style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Microbiome analysis</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Alpha diversity for caterpillar and soil was assessed on the rarefied datasets by calculating the estimated species richness, Shannon diversity (the exponential of Shannon entropy), and Simpson diversity (the inverse Simpson concentration) [27], using the <i>iNEXT</i> R package [28]. These indices are based on sample-size interpolation and extrapolation sampling curves [29], and represent the diversity estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples with respect to the number of samples within localities. The estimated diversity was compared between habitats using the nonparametric Wilcoxon test with pairwise adjusted (Holm) p-values. Because caterpillars in the natural populations varied in size (see <span>SI Table S1 and Figure S</span>3 for average weights), to assess potential associations between the fresh biomass of caterpillars and their microbial species diversity or community composition, we used the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and multivariate GLMs (see method description below), respectively. Moreover, to test whether spatial distribution of the sampled localities had an effect on the structure of bacterial communities in caterpillars, we computed a Mantel test correlation between the distance among localities in kilometers, calculated with the <i>geosphere</i> R package [30] on the geographic coordinates, and the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix bacterial composition of caterpillars. The rarefied relative abundance data were squared-root transformed and Wisconsin double-standardized before the calculation of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix using the <i>vegan</i> R package [31]. This standardization scales the variability of different samples to each other.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">To display differences in microbiome composition of caterpillar and soil samples among localities within the three habitats, we generated Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) ordination plots using the <i>ape</i> R package [32], using the squared-root transformed and Wisconsin double-standardized data. To reduce the influence of taxa present in few samples to the overall community composition, only ASVs present in at least three caterpillar or soil samples with a relative abundance higher than 0.1% in each dataset were included in the PCoA. The homogeneity of dispersion of the microbiome data was tested using <i>betadisper</i> function in <i>vegan</i> R package, and for both caterpillars and soil in the nine localities within the three habitats, data were overdispersed. We recognize that distance-based approaches can perform poorly when the data presents strong mean-variance relationships [33], therefore we used it only as a means to visualize differences in microbiomes.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">To assess caterpillar and soil microbiome community differences between localities and within habitats, we used a multivariate model-based approach [34], using the <i>mvabund</i> R package [35]. The microbiome structure of caterpillars or soil within locations or habitats was tested in separate models. We used a GLM with negative binomial distribution and a log-link function to account for the overdispersion of the data. In the multivariate GLM, a model was fit to each ASV and the log-likelihood ratio (LR) of each model was summed to create an overall sum-of-LR [34]. Examination of the residual plots from the models showed no clear patterns indicating that the negative binomial GLM model was appropriate. Significance of the models was evaluated using 999 resampling iterations with PIT-trap resampling [36]. In addition, a linear discriminant analysis coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe) based on Wilcoxon sum-rank test [37] was used to screen for differentially abundant bacteria at any taxonomic level among the three habitats.</p>

Both caterpillar and soil samples were stored at -20 ∞C until further processing. Caterpillar samples were lyophilized prior to DNA extractions.†</p>

<h3 style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">DNA extraction and library preparation</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">To obtain a representative sample of caterpillars feeding on one plant, DNA was extracted collectively from three homogenized caterpillars, from approximately 10 mg of dry, lyophilized sample. In total, 270 caterpillars were used in this study (9 study locations x 10 plants x 3 caterpillars per sample). Extractions were performed using the MP Biomedicals FastDNAô Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol with the following modifications. Samples homogenized with Cell Lysis Solution in the FastPrepÆ Instrument (MP Biomedicals) for 20 seconds (speed setting of 6.0) were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. An extra washing step was included, and the final eluted DNA was additionally precipitated prior further purification using standard ethanol precipitation method with potassium acetate.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">From approximately 0.35 g of soil samples, DNA was extracted from 90 samples using DNeasy PowerSoil Kit DNA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Approximately 10 ng of template DNA was used for PCR using primers 515FB [21] and 806RB [22] targeting the V4 habitat of the 16S rRNA gene [23]. The PCR mixture (25 µl) contained 12.5 µl Phusion Flash High Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific), 1.25 µl of each of the primers (10 µM). The conditions were 45 s at 98 ∞C, followed by 30 cycles for caterpillars and 25 for soil samples of 98 ∞C for 5 s, 55 ∞C for 5 s, and 72 ∞C for 10 s with a final extension of 1 min at 72 ∞C. The PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Adapters and barcodes were added to samples using Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit sets A-B (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The final PCR product was purified again with AMPure beads, verified using agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Hudson, NH, USA) before equimolar pooling. Separate libraries were prepared for bacterial communities derived from caterpillar and soil samples (96 samples per library) including extraction negatives. Libraries were sequenced at McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Center.</p>

<h3 style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Sequence processing</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Raw reads were processed into ASVs (amplicon sequence variants) using the DADA2 pipeline [24], and taxonomic identification was performed by querying against the SILVA database with SINA classifier [25]. Reads that could not be assigned to Bacteria (i.e. Archaea, Eukaryotes, mitochondria, chloroplast, and unidentified) and all the bacterial ASVs present in the extraction negatives were excluded. The percentage of mitochondria and chloroplast reads was variable between samples, as it is often reported in insect gut microbiome studies [26], but did not significantly differ between localities or regions (SI Figure S2). Caterpillar and soil datasets were filtered separately due to their inherent differences in bacterial diversity. Only samples with sequencing depth ranging from five times more to five times less than the mean sequencing depth of caterpillar or soil samples were kept for further analysis. To explore general patterns of bacterial diversity among samples, the caterpillar and soil datasets were resampled to the lowest sequencing depth of 3,849 and 13,731 reads, respectively. This resulted in removing three caterpillar samples (one from each habitat); while all soil samples were kept. The combined rarefied datasets resulted in 1,570,653 reads assigned to 41,089 bacterial ASVs, of which 11,685 ASVs were present in high abundance (&gt;0.1% relative abundance).</p>

<h3 style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Microbiome analysis</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">Alpha diversity for caterpillar and soil was assessed on the rarefied datasets by calculating the estimated species richness, Shannon diversity (the exponential of Shannon entropy), and Simpson diversity (the inverse Simpson concentration) [27], using the <i>iNEXT</i> R package [28]. These indices are based on sample-size interpolation and extrapolation sampling curves [29], and represent the diversity estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples with respect to the number of samples within localities. The estimated diversity was compared between habitats using the nonparametric Wilcoxon test with pairwise adjusted (Holm) p-values. Because caterpillars in the natural populations varied in size (see <span>SI Table S1 and Figure S</span>3 for average weights), to assess potential associations between the fresh biomass of caterpillars and their microbial species diversity or community composition, we used the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and multivariate GLMs (see method description below), respectively. Moreover, to test whether spatial distribution of the sampled localities had an effect on the structure of bacterial communities in caterpillars, we computed a Mantel test correlation between the distance among localities in kilometers, calculated with the <i>geosphere</i> R package [30] on the geographic coordinates, and the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix bacterial composition of caterpillars. The rarefied relative abundance data were squared-root transformed and Wisconsin double-standardized before the calculation of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix using the <i>vegan</i> R package [31]. This standardization scales the variability of different samples to each other.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">To display differences in microbiome composition of caterpillar and soil samples among localities within the three habitats, we generated Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) ordination plots using the <i>ape</i> R package [32], using the squared-root transformed and Wisconsin double-standardized data. To reduce the influence of taxa present in few samples to the overall community composition, only ASVs present in at least three caterpillar or soil samples with a relative abundance higher than 0.1% in each dataset were included in the PCoA. The homogeneity of dispersion of the microbiome data was tested using <i>betadisper</i> function in <i>vegan</i> R package, and for both caterpillars and soil in the nine localities within the three habitats, data were overdispersed. We recognize that distance-based approaches can perform poorly when the data presents strong mean-variance relationships [33], therefore we used it only as a means to visualize differences in microbiomes.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;"">To assess caterpillar and soil microbiome community differences between localities and within habitats, we used a multivariate model-based approach [34], using the <i>mvabund</i> R package [35]. The microbiome structure of caterpillars or soil within locations or habitats was tested in separate models. We used a GLM with negative binomial distribution and a log-link function to account for the overdispersion of the data. In the multivariate GLM, a model was fit to each ASV and the log-likelihood ratio (LR) of each model was summed to create an overall sum-of-LR [34]. Examination of the residual plots from the models showed no clear patterns indicating that the negative binomial GLM model was appropriate. Significance of the models was evaluated using 999 resampling iterations with PIT-trap resampling [36]. In addition, a linear discriminant analysis coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe) based on Wilcoxon sum-rank test [37] was used to screen for differentially abundant bacteria at any taxonomic level among the three habitats.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;"">†</p> <p><b>Background</b>: Insect-associated microorganisms can provide a wide range of benefits to their host, but insect dependency on these microbes varies greatly. The origin and functionality of insect microbiomes is not well understood. Many caterpillars can harbor symbionts in their gut that impact host metabolism, nutrient uptake and pathogen protection. Despite our lack of knowledge on the ecological factors driving microbiome assemblages of wild caterpillars, they seem to be highly variable and influenced by diet and environment. Several recent studies have shown that shoot-feeding caterpillars acquire part of their microbiome from the soil. Here, we examine microbiomes of a monophagous caterpillar (<i>Tyria jacobaeae</i>) collected from its natural host plant (<i>Jacobaeae vulgaris</i>) growing in three different environments: coastal dunes, natural inland grasslands and riverine grasslands, and compare the bacterial communities of the wild caterpillars to those of soil samples collected from underneath each of the host plants from which the caterpillars were collected.</p>

<p><b>Results</b>: The microbiomes of the caterpillars were dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Only 5% of the total bacterial diversity represented 86.2% of the total caterpillar's microbiome. Interestingly, we found a high consistency of dominant bacteria within the family Burkholderiaceae in all caterpillar samples across the three habitats. There was one amplicon sequence variant belonging to the genus <i>Ralstonia</i> that represented on average 53% of total community composition across all caterpillars. On average, one quarter of the caterpillar microbiome was shared with the soil.</p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b>: We found that the monophagous caterpillars collected from fields located more than 100 kilometers apart were all dominated by a single <i>Ralstonia</i>. The remainder of the bacterial communities that were present resembled the local microbial communities in the soil in which the host plant was growing. Our findings provide an example of a caterpillar that has just a few key associated bacteria, but that also contains a community of low abundant bacteria characteristic of soil communities.</p> <p>Funding provided by: Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246<br>Award Number: 865.14.006</p>  ",1,0,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Netherlands

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2547d7wp3,Data from: Above-belowground linkages of functionally dissimilar plant communities and soil properties in a grassland experiment,"<p>Changes in plant community composition can have long-lasting consequences for ecosystem functioning. However, how the duration of plant growth of functionally distinct grassland plant communities influences abiotic and biotic soil properties and thus ecosystem functions is poorly known. In a field experiment, we established identical experimental subplots in two successive years comprising of fast- or slow-growing grass and forb community mixtures with different forb:grass ratios. After one and two years of plant growth, we measured above- and belowground biomass, soil abiotic characteristics (pH, organic matter, soil nutrients), soil microbial properties (respiration, biomass, community composition), and nematode abundance. Fast- and slow-growing plant communities did not differ in above- and belowground biomass. However, fast-and slow-growing plant communities created distinct soil bacterial communities, whereas soil fungal communities differed most in 100% forb communities compared to other forb:grass ratio mixtures. Moreover, soil nitrate availability was higher after two years of plant growth, whereas the opposite was true for soil ammonium concentrations. Furthermore, total nematodes and especially bacterial-feeding nematodes were more abundant after two years of plant growth. Our results show that plant community composition is a driving factor in soil microbial community assembly and that the duration of plant growth plays a crucial role in the establishment of plant community and functional group composition effects on abiotic and biotic soil ecosystem functioning under natural field conditions.</p>","<p>The experimental site was established in spring 2015 in a restored grassland site (abandoned from agricultural use in 1996), ""De Mossel"" (Natuurmonumenten, Ede, The Netherlands, 52∞ 04¥ N, 5∞ 45¥ E). The area around ""De Mossel"" is characterized by a mean daily temperature of 16.7 ∞C in summer months and 1.7 ∞C in winter months and monthly precipitation ranges from 48 to 76 mm (based on open source data from long-term climate models; <a href=""http://www.climate-data.org/"">www.climate-data.org</a>). The soil of the field site is described as a holtpodzol and soil texture is characterized as sandy loam (94% sand, 4% silt, 2% clay, ~5% organic matter, 5.2 pH, 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> N, 4.0 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> P, 16.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> K) (Jeffery et al. 2017).</p>

<p>In total, 100 experimental plots (1.66 x 2.50 m) were installed and each plot was divided into two subplots (each 0.83 ¥ 2.50 m) resulting in 200 subplots (De Long et al. 2019). Experimental plots were randomly arranged in four blocks. To study the effects of the duration of plant growth of distinct plant communities, the top-soil (about 4 cm depth) including the previously existing plant communities of 100 subplots was removed in May 2015 (later referred to as ""two-year subplots"") whereupon experimental plant communities were sown immediately. In May 2016 (later referred to as ""one-year subplots"") the top-soil including the previously existing plant communities was removed of the remaining 100 subplots and experimental plant communities were then sown. In total, 24 predominantly perennial plant communities based on their economic spectrum (fast- versus slow-growing species) and differences in forb:grass ratio were chosen. Fast- or slow-growing grasses or forbs were selected from a pool of 24 grassland species that all co-occur locally at this site. Plants were assigned to fast- versus slow-growing species based on known growth rates (Fitter and Peat 1994, Fry et al. 2014) or after consultation with botanists (Jasper van Ruijven, Henrik Poorter, personal communication). Three fast- (Fast 1, Fast 2, Fast 3) and three slow- (Slow 1, Slow 2, Slow 3) growing plant communities were used in the experiment, each mixture consisted of 3 or 6 plant species (three grasses and/or three forbs) (Table 1). Specifically, sown plant communities differed in forb:grass ratios as per seeding such as a) three fast- or slow-growing forb species (100%); b) three fast- or slow-growing grass species (100%); or c) three fast- or slow-growing forbs and three fast- or slow-growing grasses (25% grass and 75% forb or 75% forb and 25% grass). Sowing density amounted to 12,000 seeds per subplot, representing each plant species in equal amounts of seeds. Seeds were obtained from specialized suppliers that provide seeds collected from wild plants (Cruydt Hoeck, Nijeberkoop, The Netherlands and MediGran, Hoorn, The Netherlands) in 2015. Additionally, after top-soil removal, in each block two experimental subplots were kept bare one from May 2015 onwards, and one from May 2016. These plots served as a control to permit the comparison of ecosystem processes in the absence of vegetation. In 2015 and 2016, during the growth season (May through September) all sown subplots and bare control subplots were regularly weeded to maintain the sown plant community composition. In total, this resulted in 2 temporal treatments (two- and one-year; represented by the level of subplots) and 25 plant community treatment combinations (2 community growth rates (fast, slow) ¥ 4 forb:grass ratios (0:100; 25:75; 75:25 or 100:0 % forb:grass; represented by the level of plots) ¥ 3 species combinations + 1 bare control), which were replicated across four blocks (200 subplots). The efficiency of the establishment of experimental plant communities was reported previously in De Long et al. (2019). Here, it was shown that the six different plant communities (Fast 1, Fast 2, Fast 3, Slow 1, Slow 2, Slow 3) significantly differed in their composition whereas fast-growing plant communities and slow-growing plant communities were clustering separately. Furthermore, it was reported that the actual percentage cover of both forbs and grasses corresponded well to the treatments.</p>

<h3>Data collection</h3>

<p><i>Above- and belowground biomass </i>- In the beginning of June 2017, aboveground biomass production was assessed within two randomly selected squares (25 x 25 cm; minimum 10 cm distant to the edge) in each subplot by cutting plants just above the soil level. Aboveground biomass of all samples was determined by weighing after drying at 70∞C for 72 h and later converted to g per m≤. After the aboveground biomass was clipped in a subplot, one soil core (diameter 3 cm, 10 cm deep) was taken from the center of the square. The fresh soil weight was determined, and the roots were then washed over a 0.425 mm sieve. Root biomass was then determined after drying at 40 ∞C for 72 h and later converted to gram per gram fresh weight of soil.</p>

<p><i>Soil sampling </i>- Soil sampling was carried out in two sampling campaigns. First, soil samples were collected in March 2017. Here, 20 soil samples (metal corer: diameter 1 cm, 10 cm deep) were taken randomly per subplot, pooled and homogenized. Approximately 2 g of fresh soil was immediately frozen at -80 ∞C for DNA-based determination of the soil microbial community composition. In mid May 2017, an additional 20 soil samples (metal corer: diameter 3 cm, 10 cm deep) were taken randomly per subplot. The soil samples were pooled, homogenized and divided into several subsamples. About 50 g of fresh soil for nematode extraction was kept in a fridge (4 ∞C). Approximately 20 g was sieved (2 mm mesh size) to remove stones, roots, and invertebrates &gt;2 mm, and then stored at -20 ∞C for measurements of soil microbial properties (soil microbial respiration and biomass), the remaining soil was dried at 40 ∞C and used to measure soil abiotic characteristics.</p>

<p><i>Soil abiotic characteristics</i> - The soil was dried at 40 ∞C until the soil weight was stable and sieved (mesh size: 1.4 mm) to remove roots and stones. Three grams of dried soil were mixed with 30 ml of 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> and shaken for 2 h on a mechanical shaker with linear movement at 250 rpm. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm. Then, 15 mL of the supernatant was filtered through a Whatman Puradisc Aqua 30 syringe filter with a cellulose acetate membrane and 130 ?L HNO<sub>3</sub> was added to 12.87 mL of the filtrate. Soil extractable elements (Fe, K, Mg, P, S, Zn) were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES,†Thermo Scientific†iCAP†6500†Duo†Instrument with axial and radial view and CID detector microwave digestion system). The remaining filtrate (2.13 mL) was used to measure soil pH and to measure nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>-N) + nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>-N) and ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>-N) on a QuAAtro Autoanalyzer (Seal analytical).</p>

<p><i>Soil organic matter</i> - Soil organic matter content was estimated by the loss?on?ignition (LOI) method (Heiri et al. 2001). Approximately 5 g of soil was oven dried at 105 ∞C for 16 h and weighed. The sample was then burned at 550 ∞C for 5 h and weighed again. Soil organic matter was calculated as the percentage weight loss between the oven-dried and burned samples.</p>

<p><i>Soil microbial respiration and biomass</i> - Approximately 5 g soil (fresh weight) was weighed into 50 mL centrifuge tubes to determine soil microbial respiration and soil microbial biomass. The lid of each tube was sealed gas-tight using an O-ring and a rubber septum in the middle. For basal respiration measurements, the tubes were capped and flushed with CO<sub>2</sub>-free air to remove any CO<sub>2</sub> from the headspace. After 24 h hours of incubation at 20 ∞C, 12 ml of headspace was sampled using a gas-tight syringe. Microbial biomass was determined after addition of D-glucose-monohydrate using the substrate-induced respiration method (SIR) (Anderson and Domsch, 1978). Next, 2 ml of 75 mM D-glucose solution were added to each soil sample and placed on a horizontal shaker for 1 h. Tubes were capped, flushed with CO<sub>2</sub>-free air and incubated for 4 h at 20 ∞C. Again, 12 ml of headspace was sampled. Measurements of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were carried out on a Trace CG Ultra gas chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy). Gravimetric soil water content was determined by drying the soil samples overnight at 60 ∞C to constant weight and calculating the difference in weight between fresh and dried soil.</p>

<p><i>Soil microbial community composition</i> - DNA was extracted from 0.75 g of soil using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA quantity was measured using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Hudson, NH, USA). Approximately 100 ng of DNA was used for a PCR. We used the primers ITS4ngs and ITS3mix targeting the ITS2 region of fungal genes (Tedersoo et al. 2015) and the primers 515FB and 806RB (Caporaso et al. 2012, Apprill et al. 2015, Parada et al. 2016) targeting the V4 region of the 16Sr RNA gene in bacteria. Presence of PCR product was checked using agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). Adapters and barcodes were added to samples using Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit set A (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The final PCR product was purified again with AMPure beads, checked using agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer before equimolar pooling. We pooled all fungal samples (200) in one Miseq PE250 run and divided the bacterial samples in two separate runs (100 samples each; 1<sup>st</sup> run: block 1 and 2, 2<sup>nd</sup> run: block 3 and 4). Libraries were sequenced at McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Center, Canada. Extraction negatives were also sequenced. A mock community, containing 10 fungal species, was included to investigate the accuracy of the bioinformatics analysis.</p>

<p>Bacterial sequences and fungal sequences were analyzed using the PIPITS pipeline and the Hydra pipeline, respectively (Gweon et al. 2015, Hollander 2017). In short, fungal sequences were paired using VSEARCH and quality was filtered using standard parameters. The ITS2 region was extracted using ITSx (Bengtsson-Palme et al. 2013). Short reads were removed, and sequences were clustered based on a 97% similarity threshold using VSEARCH and chimeric sequences were removed by comparing with UNITE uchime database. The representative sequences were identified using the RDP classifier against the UNITE database (Kıljalg et al. 2005). For bacterial sequences VSEARCH was used to pair sequences and cluster them or classification, SINA classification was used with the SILVA database.</p>

<p><i>Nematode extraction</i> - Decantation (Cobb 1918) and centrifugal flotation methods (Van Bezooijen 2006) were used to extract nematodes from 50 g fresh soil collected from block 1 and 2 (100 subplots). Briefly, soil samples were weighed, suspended in 3 L water and stirred until a homogenous suspension was obtained. The suspension was settled for 15 sec and the supernatant decanted into a plastic bowl. This procedure was repeated three times and the obtained suspension was passed through one 75 µm and three 45 µm sieves and collected into a 50 ml centrifuge tube. The nematode suspension was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm and the supernatant was carefully poured off. Sugar solution (484 g/L) was added, fully mixed with the remaining sediment in the tube and centrifuged again for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was poured over a 30 µm sieve. Nematodes on the sieve were carefully rinsed with water and collected in a beaker for microscopic analysis). All nematodes were counted and classified by microscopy to one of five feeding types (root feeders, fungivores, omnivores, bacterivores, or predators) according to Yeates et al. (1993). However, predatory nematodes were excluded from further analysis because of low abundance.</p>

<p>We used linear mixed-effects models to test the effects of duration of plant growth (one- and two-year subplots), community growth rates (fast vs. slow), and forb:grass ratios on above- and root biomass, soil abiotic characteristics (pH, Fe, K, Mg, P, S, Zn, NO<sub>2</sub>-N +NO<sub>3</sub>-N, NH<sub>4</sub>-N), soil organic matter, soil microbial properties, and feeding types of nematodes. Thereby, plot and plant community identity (Fast 1, Fast 2, Fast 3, Slow 1, Slow 2, Slow 3) were included as random factors. Above- and belowground biomass, chemical abiotic characteristics and soil microbial properties (respiration and biomass) data were ln- transformed to meet assumptions of ANOVA. Linear mixed- effects models were performed using <i>lme4</i> package (Bates et al. 2015), whereas p-values and degrees of freedom were estimated with Type III Kenward-Roger approximation using <i>lmerTest </i>(Kuznetsova et al. 2017). We further used comparisons of means for treatment- specific effects (Tukey's HSD test; ? &lt; 0.05). Tukey's tests were performed using and <i>multcomp</i> package (Hothorn et al. 2016). Bare plots were excluded from analysis, but their values are displayed in graphs.</p>

<p>To test the effects of duration of plant growth, community growth rates, and forb:grass ratios on bacterial and fungal community compositions, we first filtered out taxa that were present in less than ten samples and had an abundance of less than 0.01%. ITS sequences derived from other organisms than fungi were further removed and for 16S rRNA data mitochondria and chloroplast sequences were removed. For both bacteria and fungi, samples with less than 1000 reads of more than 80 000 reads remaining were removed from the dataset and read numbers were further normalized using total sum scaling (TSS). Mock communities consisting of 10 fungal species were used to inspect the filtering done for fungi. After filtering, we detected 13 fungal OTUs which shows that we might be slightly overestimating the diversity. Afterwards, we ran permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) (based on BrayñCurtis dissimilarities, 999 permutations) on both bacterial and fungal OTUs using the <i>""adonis""</i> function in the <i>vegan</i> package (Oksanen et al. 2016). However, here we only used one- and two-year subplots to test for the differences in plant community effect on soil microbial community composition. Since the basic assumption of PERMANOVA analysis is a balanced design and homogenization of samples, bare subplots were excluded due to lower number of samples than the one-and two-year subplots. For visualization we applied a nonmetric multidimensional (NMDS) analysis of the dissimilarities (based on BrayñCurtis dissimilarities) in microbial community composition using <i>ggplot2</i> package (Wickham 2016). All statistics were performed within the R statistical environment (Version 3.5.1; R Core Team, 2018).</p>",<p>Funding provided by: Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246<br>Award Number: NWO VICI grant 865.14.006</p>,,,2020-09-01,,"9,7,4,8",zenodo,"Data from: Above-belowground linkages of functionally dissimilar plant communities and soil properties in a grassland experiment <p>The experimental site was established in spring 2015 in a restored grassland site (abandoned from agricultural use in 1996), ""De Mossel"" (Natuurmonumenten, Ede, The Netherlands, 52∞ 04¥ N, 5∞ 45¥ E). The area around ""De Mossel"" is characterized by a mean daily temperature of 16.7 ∞C in summer months and 1.7 ∞C in winter months and monthly precipitation ranges from 48 to 76 mm (based on open source data from long-term climate models; <a href=""http://www.climate-data.org/"">www.climate-data.org</a>). The soil of the field site is described as a holtpodzol and soil texture is characterized as sandy loam (94% sand, 4% silt, 2% clay, ~5% organic matter, 5.2 pH, 2.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> N, 4.0 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> P, 16.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> K) (Jeffery et al. 2017).</p>

<p>In total, 100 experimental plots (1.66 x 2.50 m) were installed and each plot was divided into two subplots (each 0.83 ¥ 2.50 m) resulting in 200 subplots (De Long et al. 2019). Experimental plots were randomly arranged in four blocks. To study the effects of the duration of plant growth of distinct plant communities, the top-soil (about 4 cm depth) including the previously existing plant communities of 100 subplots was removed in May 2015 (later referred to as ""two-year subplots"") whereupon experimental plant communities were sown immediately. In May 2016 (later referred to as ""one-year subplots"") the top-soil including the previously existing plant communities was removed of the remaining 100 subplots and experimental plant communities were then sown. In total, 24 predominantly perennial plant communities based on their economic spectrum (fast- versus slow-growing species) and differences in forb:grass ratio were chosen. Fast- or slow-growing grasses or forbs were selected from a pool of 24 grassland species that all co-occur locally at this site. Plants were assigned to fast- versus slow-growing species based on known growth rates (Fitter and Peat 1994, Fry et al. 2014) or after consultation with botanists (Jasper van Ruijven, Henrik Poorter, personal communication). Three fast- (Fast 1, Fast 2, Fast 3) and three slow- (Slow 1, Slow 2, Slow 3) growing plant communities were used in the experiment, each mixture consisted of 3 or 6 plant species (three grasses and/or three forbs) (Table 1). Specifically, sown plant communities differed in forb:grass ratios as per seeding such as a) three fast- or slow-growing forb species (100%); b) three fast- or slow-growing grass species (100%); or c) three fast- or slow-growing forbs and three fast- or slow-growing grasses (25% grass and 75% forb or 75% forb and 25% grass). Sowing density amounted to 12,000 seeds per subplot, representing each plant species in equal amounts of seeds. Seeds were obtained from specialized suppliers that provide seeds collected from wild plants (Cruydt Hoeck, Nijeberkoop, The Netherlands and MediGran, Hoorn, The Netherlands) in 2015. Additionally, after top-soil removal, in each block two experimental subplots were kept bare one from May 2015 onwards, and one from May 2016. These plots served as a control to permit the comparison of ecosystem processes in the absence of vegetation. In 2015 and 2016, during the growth season (May through September) all sown subplots and bare control subplots were regularly weeded to maintain the sown plant community composition. In total, this resulted in 2 temporal treatments (two- and one-year; represented by the level of subplots) and 25 plant community treatment combinations (2 community growth rates (fast, slow) ¥ 4 forb:grass ratios (0:100; 25:75; 75:25 or 100:0 % forb:grass; represented by the level of plots) ¥ 3 species combinations + 1 bare control), which were replicated across four blocks (200 subplots). The efficiency of the establishment of experimental plant communities was reported previously in De Long et al. (2019). Here, it was shown that the six different plant communities (Fast 1, Fast 2, Fast 3, Slow 1, Slow 2, Slow 3) significantly differed in their composition whereas fast-growing plant communities and slow-growing plant communities were clustering separately. Furthermore, it was reported that the actual percentage cover of both forbs and grasses corresponded well to the treatments.</p>

<h3>Data collection</h3>

<p><i>Above- and belowground biomass </i>- In the beginning of June 2017, aboveground biomass production was assessed within two randomly selected squares (25 x 25 cm; minimum 10 cm distant to the edge) in each subplot by cutting plants just above the soil level. Aboveground biomass of all samples was determined by weighing after drying at 70∞C for 72 h and later converted to g per m≤. After the aboveground biomass was clipped in a subplot, one soil core (diameter 3 cm, 10 cm deep) was taken from the center of the square. The fresh soil weight was determined, and the roots were then washed over a 0.425 mm sieve. Root biomass was then determined after drying at 40 ∞C for 72 h and later converted to gram per gram fresh weight of soil.</p>

<p><i>Soil sampling </i>- Soil sampling was carried out in two sampling campaigns. First, soil samples were collected in March 2017. Here, 20 soil samples (metal corer: diameter 1 cm, 10 cm deep) were taken randomly per subplot, pooled and homogenized. Approximately 2 g of fresh soil was immediately frozen at -80 ∞C for DNA-based determination of the soil microbial community composition. In mid May 2017, an additional 20 soil samples (metal corer: diameter 3 cm, 10 cm deep) were taken randomly per subplot. The soil samples were pooled, homogenized and divided into several subsamples. About 50 g of fresh soil for nematode extraction was kept in a fridge (4 ∞C). Approximately 20 g was sieved (2 mm mesh size) to remove stones, roots, and invertebrates &gt;2 mm, and then stored at -20 ∞C for measurements of soil microbial properties (soil microbial respiration and biomass), the remaining soil was dried at 40 ∞C and used to measure soil abiotic characteristics.</p>

<p><i>Soil abiotic characteristics</i> - The soil was dried at 40 ∞C until the soil weight was stable and sieved (mesh size: 1.4 mm) to remove roots and stones. Three grams of dried soil were mixed with 30 ml of 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> and shaken for 2 h on a mechanical shaker with linear movement at 250 rpm. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm. Then, 15 mL of the supernatant was filtered through a Whatman Puradisc Aqua 30 syringe filter with a cellulose acetate membrane and 130 ?L HNO<sub>3</sub> was added to 12.87 mL of the filtrate. Soil extractable elements (Fe, K, Mg, P, S, Zn) were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES,†Thermo Scientific†iCAP†6500†Duo†Instrument with axial and radial view and CID detector microwave digestion system). The remaining filtrate (2.13 mL) was used to measure soil pH and to measure nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>-N) + nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>-N) and ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>-N) on a QuAAtro Autoanalyzer (Seal analytical).</p>

<p><i>Soil organic matter</i> - Soil organic matter content was estimated by the loss?on?ignition (LOI) method (Heiri et al. 2001). Approximately 5 g of soil was oven dried at 105 ∞C for 16 h and weighed. The sample was then burned at 550 ∞C for 5 h and weighed again. Soil organic matter was calculated as the percentage weight loss between the oven-dried and burned samples.</p>

<p><i>Soil microbial respiration and biomass</i> - Approximately 5 g soil (fresh weight) was weighed into 50 mL centrifuge tubes to determine soil microbial respiration and soil microbial biomass. The lid of each tube was sealed gas-tight using an O-ring and a rubber septum in the middle. For basal respiration measurements, the tubes were capped and flushed with CO<sub>2</sub>-free air to remove any CO<sub>2</sub> from the headspace. After 24 h hours of incubation at 20 ∞C, 12 ml of headspace was sampled using a gas-tight syringe. Microbial biomass was determined after addition of D-glucose-monohydrate using the substrate-induced respiration method (SIR) (Anderson and Domsch, 1978). Next, 2 ml of 75 mM D-glucose solution were added to each soil sample and placed on a horizontal shaker for 1 h. Tubes were capped, flushed with CO<sub>2</sub>-free air and incubated for 4 h at 20 ∞C. Again, 12 ml of headspace was sampled. Measurements of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were carried out on a Trace CG Ultra gas chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy). Gravimetric soil water content was determined by drying the soil samples overnight at 60 ∞C to constant weight and calculating the difference in weight between fresh and dried soil.</p>

<p><i>Soil microbial community composition</i> - DNA was extracted from 0.75 g of soil using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA quantity was measured using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Hudson, NH, USA). Approximately 100 ng of DNA was used for a PCR. We used the primers ITS4ngs and ITS3mix targeting the ITS2 region of fungal genes (Tedersoo et al. 2015) and the primers 515FB and 806RB (Caporaso et al. 2012, Apprill et al. 2015, Parada et al. 2016) targeting the V4 region of the 16Sr RNA gene in bacteria. Presence of PCR product was checked using agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). Adapters and barcodes were added to samples using Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit set A (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The final PCR product was purified again with AMPure beads, checked using agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer before equimolar pooling. We pooled all fungal samples (200) in one Miseq PE250 run and divided the bacterial samples in two separate runs (100 samples each; 1<sup>st</sup> run: block 1 and 2, 2<sup>nd</sup> run: block 3 and 4). Libraries were sequenced at McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Center, Canada. Extraction negatives were also sequenced. A mock community, containing 10 fungal species, was included to investigate the accuracy of the bioinformatics analysis.</p>

<p>Bacterial sequences and fungal sequences were analyzed using the PIPITS pipeline and the Hydra pipeline, respectively (Gweon et al. 2015, Hollander 2017). In short, fungal sequences were paired using VSEARCH and quality was filtered using standard parameters. The ITS2 region was extracted using ITSx (Bengtsson-Palme et al. 2013). Short reads were removed, and sequences were clustered based on a 97% similarity threshold using VSEARCH and chimeric sequences were removed by comparing with UNITE uchime database. The representative sequences were identified using the RDP classifier against the UNITE database (Kıljalg et al. 2005). For bacterial sequences VSEARCH was used to pair sequences and cluster them or classification, SINA classification was used with the SILVA database.</p>

<p><i>Nematode extraction</i> - Decantation (Cobb 1918) and centrifugal flotation methods (Van Bezooijen 2006) were used to extract nematodes from 50 g fresh soil collected from block 1 and 2 (100 subplots). Briefly, soil samples were weighed, suspended in 3 L water and stirred until a homogenous suspension was obtained. The suspension was settled for 15 sec and the supernatant decanted into a plastic bowl. This procedure was repeated three times and the obtained suspension was passed through one 75 µm and three 45 µm sieves and collected into a 50 ml centrifuge tube. The nematode suspension was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm and the supernatant was carefully poured off. Sugar solution (484 g/L) was added, fully mixed with the remaining sediment in the tube and centrifuged again for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was poured over a 30 µm sieve. Nematodes on the sieve were carefully rinsed with water and collected in a beaker for microscopic analysis). All nematodes were counted and classified by microscopy to one of five feeding types (root feeders, fungivores, omnivores, bacterivores, or predators) according to Yeates et al. (1993). However, predatory nematodes were excluded from further analysis because of low abundance.</p>

<p>We used linear mixed-effects models to test the effects of duration of plant growth (one- and two-year subplots), community growth rates (fast vs. slow), and forb:grass ratios on above- and root biomass, soil abiotic characteristics (pH, Fe, K, Mg, P, S, Zn, NO<sub>2</sub>-N +NO<sub>3</sub>-N, NH<sub>4</sub>-N), soil organic matter, soil microbial properties, and feeding types of nematodes. Thereby, plot and plant community identity (Fast 1, Fast 2, Fast 3, Slow 1, Slow 2, Slow 3) were included as random factors. Above- and belowground biomass, chemical abiotic characteristics and soil microbial properties (respiration and biomass) data were ln- transformed to meet assumptions of ANOVA.

However, how the duration of plant growth of functionally distinct grassland plant communities influences abiotic and biotic soil properties and thus ecosystem functions is poorly known. In a field experiment, we established identical experimental subplots in two successive years comprising of fast- or slow-growing grass and forb community mixtures with different forb:grass ratios. After one and two years of plant growth, we measured above- and belowground biomass, soil abiotic characteristics (pH, organic matter, soil nutrients), soil microbial properties (respiration, biomass, community composition), and nematode abundance. Fast- and slow-growing plant communities did not differ in above- and belowground biomass. However, fast-and slow-growing plant communities created distinct soil bacterial communities, whereas soil fungal communities differed most in 100% forb communities compared to other forb:grass ratio mixtures. Moreover, soil nitrate availability was higher after two years of plant growth, whereas the opposite was true for soil ammonium concentrations. Furthermore, total nematodes and especially bacterial-feeding nematodes were more abundant after two years of plant growth. Our results show that plant community composition is a driving factor in soil microbial community assembly and that the duration of plant growth plays a crucial role in the establishment of plant community and functional group composition effects on abiotic and biotic soil ecosystem functioning under natural field conditions.</p> <p>Funding provided by: Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246<br>Award Number: NWO VICI grant 865.14.006</p>  ",1,0,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Netherlands
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dbrv15f1c,"Range shifts in butternut, a rare, endangered tree, in response to past climate and modern conditions","<p><strong>Aim: </strong>Range shifts are a key process that determine species distributions and genetic patterns. A previous investigation reported that <em>Juglans cinerea</em> (butternut) has lower genetic diversity at higher latitudes, hypothesized to be the result of range shifts following the last glacial period. However, genetic patterns can also be impacted by modern ecogeographic conditions. Therefore, we re-investigate genetic patterns of butternut with additional northern population sampling, hindcasted species distribution models, and fossil pollen records to clarify the impact of glaciation on butternut.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Eastern North America</p>
<p><strong>Taxon:</strong> <em>Juglans cinerea </em>(L., Juglandaceae) (butternut)</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> Using 11 microsatellites, we examined range-wide spatial patterns of genetic diversity metrics (allelic richness, heterozygosity, FST) for previously studied butternut individuals and an additional 757 samples. We constructed hindcast species distribution models and mapped fossil pollen records to evaluate habitat suitability and evidence of species' presence throughout space and time.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Contrary to previous work on butternut, we found that genetic diversity increased with distance to range edge, and previous latitudinal clines in diversity were likely due to a few outlier populations. Populations in New Brunswick, Canada were genetically distinct from other populations. At the Last Glacial Maximum, pollen records demonstrate butternut likely persisted near the glacial margin, and hindcast species distribution models identified suitable habitat in the southern United States and near Nova Scotia.</p>
<p><strong>Main conclusions: </strong>Genetic patterns in butternut may be shaped by both glaciation and modern environmental conditions. Pollen records and hindcast species distribution models combined with genetic distinctiveness in New Brunswick suggest that butternut may have persisted in cryptic northern refugia. We suggest that thorough sampling across a species range and evaluating multiple lines of evidence are essential to understanding past species movements.</p>","<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Arial' , sans-serif;color:black;"">For this manuscript, there were three types of methods performed to make our main conclusions: genetic diversity and structure analyses, downloading and mapping butternut fossil pollen during the last 20,000 years, and </span><span style=""font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'Arial' , sans-serif;"">modeling and hindcasting butternut's (<em>Juglans cinerea</em>) distribution 20,000 years ago to present.

Species distribution modeling was performed using boosted regression trees according to Elith et al. (2008). To run BRT, we needed to: 1. Reduce occurrence records to account for spatial autocorrelation, 2. Generate pseudo-absence points to identify the habitat where butternut is not found, 3. Obtain and extract the 19 bioclimatic variables at all points, 4. Select ecological variables least correlated with each other and most correlated with butternut presence.

A previous investigation reported that <em>Juglans cinerea</em> (butternut) has lower genetic diversity at higher latitudes, hypothesized to be the result of range shifts following the last glacial period. However, genetic patterns can also be impacted by modern ecogeographic conditions. Therefore, we re-investigate genetic patterns of butternut with additional northern population sampling, hindcasted species distribution models, and fossil pollen records to clarify the impact of glaciation on butternut.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Eastern North America</p>
<p><strong>Taxon:</strong> <em>Juglans cinerea </em>(L., Juglandaceae) (butternut)</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> Using 11 microsatellites, we examined range-wide spatial patterns of genetic diversity metrics (allelic richness, heterozygosity, FST) for previously studied butternut individuals and an additional 757 samples. We constructed hindcast species distribution models and mapped fossil pollen records to evaluate habitat suitability and evidence of species' presence throughout space and time.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Contrary to previous work on butternut, we found that genetic diversity increased with distance to range edge, and previous latitudinal clines in diversity were likely due to a few outlier populations. Populations in New Brunswick, Canada were genetically distinct from other populations. At the Last Glacial Maximum, pollen records demonstrate butternut likely persisted near the glacial margin, and hindcast species distribution models identified suitable habitat in the southern United States and near Nova Scotia.</p>
<p><strong>Main conclusions: </strong>Genetic patterns in butternut may be shaped by both glaciation and modern environmental conditions. Pollen records and hindcast species distribution models combined with genetic distinctiveness in New Brunswick suggest that butternut may have persisted in cryptic northern refugia. We suggest that thorough sampling across a species range and evaluating multiple lines of evidence are essential to understanding past species movements.</p> <p>Data was cleaned and processed in R - genetic data cleaning and analyses and species distribution modeling methods were performed in <a href=""https://github.com/ekschumacher/butternut"">Emily Schumacher's butternut repository</a> and fossil pollen data cleaning and modeling was performed in <a href=""https://github.com/alissab/juglans"">Alissa Brown's juglans repository</a>.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2bvq83brd,Nonideal nest box selection by tree swallows breeding in farmlands: evidence for an ecological trap?,"<p>Animals are expected to select a breeding habitat using cues that should reflect, directly or not, the fitness outcome of the different habitat options. However, human-induced environmental changes can alter the relationships between habitat characteristics and their fitness consequences, leading to maladaptive habitat choices. The most severe case of such nonideal habitat selection is the ecological trap, which occurs when individuals prefer to settle in poor-quality habitats while better ones are available. Here we studied the adaptiveness of nest box selection in a tree swallow (<i>Tachycineta bicolor</i>) population breeding over a 10-year period in a network of 400 nest boxes distributed along a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern QuÈbec, Canada. We first examined the effects of multiple environmental and social habitat characteristics on nest box preference to identify potential settlement cues. We then assessed the links between those cues and habitat quality as defined by the reproductive performance of individuals that settled early or late in nest boxes. We found that tree swallows preferred nesting in open habitats with high cover of perennial forage crops, high spring insect biomass, and high density of house sparrows (<i>Passer domesticus</i>), their main competitors for nest sites. They also preferred nesting where the density of breeders and their mean number of fledglings during the previous year were high. However, we detected mismatches between preference and habitat quality for several environmental variables. The density of competitors and conspecific social information showed severe mismatches, as their relationships to preference and breeding success went in opposite direction under certain circumstances. Spring food availability and agricultural landscape context, while related to preferences, were not related to breeding success. Overall, our study emphasizes the complexity of habitat selection behavior and provides evidence that multiple mechanisms may potentially lead to an ecological trap in farmlands.†</p>","<p><u>Study area</u></p>

<p>The study area included 40 farms distributed along a gradient of agricultural intensification covering approximately 10,200 km<sup>2</sup> in southern QuÈbec, Canada. Three land cover types dominated the study system: low-intensity agricultural fields (i.e. hay, alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i>), clover (<i>Trifolium</i> spp.), and pastures, henceforth referred to as ""forage crops""), intensive agricultural fields (i.e., annual row crops mainly composed of corn (<i>Zea mays</i>), soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), and wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.)) and forest.</p>

<p>Each farm included 10 identical nest boxes mostly arranged in a row along field margins and separated by at least 50 meters to limit intra and interspecific competition (see Ghilain and BÈlisle 2008 for further details on the study system). A Thermochron iButton device was fixed on the outside of one nest box on each farm to record hourly ambient temperature (model DS1922L; Embedded Data Systems, Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, USA). A pluviometer collected precipitation data (millimeters of rainfall) on each farm. We used the mean daily temperature and mean daily rainfall between May 1 and May 15 to characterize spring climate.†</p>

<p>†</p>

<p><a name=""_Toc40692184""><u>Nest monitoring</u></a></p>

<p>We monitored nest boxes every other day from 2009 to 2018 starting in the first week of May. We recorded the occurrence of nest materials, the laying date (first egg), and the number of eggs, hatchlings and fledglings. Monitoring ended when all nestlings had fledged on a given farm, which occurred between June 15 and August 5 during the study. Nest boxes were cleared of any nest material and/or dead nestlings every year in October.</p>

<p>†</p>

<p><u>Preference</u></p>

<p>Preference for each nest box was estimated for each year according to the occurrence of a laying event (at least one egg laid) and settlement date (Julian date at which nesting material was first observed).</p>

<p>†</p>

<p>Because some early settlement dates were left-censored given that some boxes already contained nest material at the first visit (45% of all boxes), settlement dates were classified as either ""early"" or ""late"" with respect to the annual median settlement date. The category ""early"" included boxes with settlement dates preceding or equal to the annual median, which comprised nearly all (91.3%) left-censored dates. Overall, the average difference between the annual mean settlement dates categorized as ""early"" and ""late"" was 10.4 ± 2.9 days (mean ± SD). Nest boxes occupied by other species were excluded from analyses (<i>N</i> = 964 boxes between 2009 and 2018). Such exclusions were made possible, even in the absence of a laying event, because the material and shape of nests are very species specific. We are thus confident that the vast majority of nests included in the study were initiated by tree swallows. The ordinal preference variable featured three categories:</p>

<p>1: No laying event</p>

<p>2: Laying event and late settlement</p>

<p>3: Laying event and early settlement</p>

<p>†</p>

<p><u>Habitat quality</u></p>

<p>We used two proxies of reproductive success: (1) the number of hatchlings produced in a nest box and (2) the proportion of hatchlings that successfully fledged in a nestbox (i.e., fledging success).</p>

<p>†</p>

<p><a name=""_Toc40692186""><u>Landscape context</u></a></p>

<p>We characterized landscape habitat composition by measuring the relative cover of forest, perennial forage crops, as well as of water bodies and wetlands, within radii of respectively 100 m, 5 km and 10 km. We assessed landscape habitat composition up to the 500-m scale on a yearly basis in the field by visually identifying cultures and marginal habitats and delineating them using orthophotos (1:40,000). Characterization beyond the 500-m scale was based on a mosaic of yearly georeferenced classified optical and radar satellite images taken between 2011 and 2018 (pixel resolution 30†m <span style=""background:white;"">◊</span> 30†m; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) 2018). Only the year 2018 was used to assess water cover at the above range of scales because it showed better accuracy than the data of previous years (AAFC, 2020), and because the cover of large water bodies, as those covered by the data we used, did not vary significantly across years (e.g., median between-year correlation of yearly water cover between 2011 and 2018 was 0.90 at the 10-km scale).</p>

<p>†</p>

<p><a name=""_Toc40692187""><u>Food availability</u></a></p>

<p>Two passive insect traps were installed on each farm around the first and second third of the nest box transect. Traps consisted of ~4-L yellow buckets placed 1.5†m above ground. They were filled with ~2†L of salty detergent solution to reduce surface tension and slow the growth of bacteria and fungi. Two transparent plexiglass screens were mounted perpendicularly to one another above each bucket to intercept flying insects (see Bellavance et al. 2018 and Garrett et al. 2021a for details). We collected the content of each trap on every visit to a farm (i.e., every other day) and conserved arthropods in 70% ethanol until processing. We sorted samples by removing arthropods unlikely to be preyed upon by tree swallows (i.e., bumble bees (<i>Bombus</i> spp.: Hymenoptera), June bugs (<i>Phyllophaga</i> spp.: Coleoptera), large spiders (Araneae, &gt; 0.5 cm body width), and caterpillars (Lepidoptera); Bellavance et al. 2018). The rest of the sample was dried at 50∫C for at least 48 hours before being weighed (Adam Equipment, model AAA250L, ±†0.0001†g). The mean daily dry biomass of arthropods collected between May 1 and May 15 was used as a proxy of yearly food availability on a given farm at the time of nest site selection.</p>

<p><u>Heterospecific social information</u></p>

<p>House sparrows (<i>Passer domesticus</i>) are tree swallow's main nest-site competitors in our system and they initiate breeding before swallows return from their wintering grounds (Robillard, Garant and BÈlisle, 2013). We evaluated the use of heterospecific social information through the number of nest boxes occupied by house sparrows on each farm in the current year. Nest boxes and house sparrow nests were visited every other day concurrently to tree swallow monitoring. Occupancy was determined by the presence of at least one egg, and only first clutches observed in each box were included since a nest box is rarely used by another species once house sparrows have built a nest therein.</p>

<p>The study area included 40 farms distributed along a gradient of agricultural intensification covering approximately 10,200 km<sup>2</sup> in southern QuÈbec, Canada. Three land cover types dominated the study system: low-intensity agricultural fields (i.e. hay, alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i>), clover (<i>Trifolium</i> spp.), and pastures, henceforth referred to as ""forage crops""), intensive agricultural fields (i.e., annual row crops mainly composed of corn (<i>Zea mays</i>), soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), and wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.)) and forest.</p>

<p>Each farm included 10 identical nest boxes mostly arranged in a row along field margins and separated by at least 50 meters to limit intra and interspecific competition (see Ghilain and BÈlisle 2008 for further details on the study system). A Thermochron iButton device was fixed on the outside of one nest box on each farm to record hourly ambient temperature (model DS1922L; Embedded Data Systems, Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, USA). A pluviometer collected precipitation data (millimeters of rainfall) on each farm. We used the mean daily temperature and mean daily rainfall between May 1 and May 15 to characterize spring climate.†</p>

<p>†</p>

<p><a name=""_Toc40692184""><u>Nest monitoring</u></a></p>

<p>We monitored nest boxes every other day from 2009 to 2018 starting in the first week of May. We recorded the occurrence of nest materials, the laying date (first egg), and the number of eggs, hatchlings and fledglings. Monitoring ended when all nestlings had fledged on a given farm, which occurred between June 15 and August 5 during the study. Nest boxes were cleared of any nest material and/or dead nestlings every year in October.</p>

<p>†</p>

<p><u>Preference</u></p>

<p>Preference for each nest box was estimated for each year according to the occurrence of a laying event (at least one egg laid) and settlement date (Julian date at which nesting material was first observed).</p>

<p>†</p>

<p>Because some early settlement dates were left-censored given that some boxes already contained nest material at the first visit (45% of all boxes), settlement dates were classified as either ""early"" or ""late"" with respect to the annual median settlement date. The category ""early"" included boxes with settlement dates preceding or equal to the annual median, which comprised nearly all (91.3%) left-censored dates. Overall, the average difference between the annual mean settlement dates categorized as ""early"" and ""late"" was 10.4 ± 2.9 days (mean ± SD). Nest boxes occupied by other species were excluded from analyses (<i>N</i> = 964 boxes between 2009 and 2018). Such exclusions were made possible, even in the absence of a laying event, because the material and shape of nests are very species specific. We are thus confident that the vast majority of nests included in the study were initiated by tree swallows. The ordinal preference variable featured three categories:</p>

<p>1: No laying event</p>

<p>2: Laying event and late settlement</p>

<p>3: Laying event and early settlement</p>

<p>†</p>

<p><u>Habitat quality</u></p>

<p>We used two proxies of reproductive success: (1) the number of hatchlings produced in a nest box and (2) the proportion of hatchlings that successfully fledged in a nestbox (i.e., fledging success).</p>

<p>†</p>

<p><a name=""_Toc40692186""><u>Landscape context</u></a></p>

<p>We characterized landscape habitat composition by measuring the relative cover of forest, perennial forage crops, as well as of water bodies and wetlands, within radii of respectively 100 m, 5 km and 10 km. We assessed landscape habitat composition up to the 500-m scale on a yearly basis in the field by visually identifying cultures and marginal habitats and delineating them using orthophotos (1:40,000). Characterization beyond the 500-m scale was based on a mosaic of yearly georeferenced classified optical and radar satellite images taken between 2011 and 2018 (pixel resolution 30†m <span style=""background:white;"">◊</span> 30†m; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) 2018). Only the year 2018 was used to assess water cover at the above range of scales because it showed better accuracy than the data of previous years (AAFC, 2020), and because the cover of large water bodies, as those covered by the data we used, did not vary significantly across years (e.g., median between-year correlation of yearly water cover between 2011 and 2018 was 0.90 at the 10-km scale).</p>

<p>†</p>

<p><a name=""_Toc40692187""><u>Food availability</u></a></p>

<p>Two passive insect traps were installed on each farm around the first and second third of the nest box transect. Traps consisted of ~4-L yellow buckets placed 1.5†m above ground. They were filled with ~2†L of salty detergent solution to reduce surface tension and slow the growth of bacteria and fungi. Two transparent plexiglass screens were mounted perpendicularly to one another above each bucket to intercept flying insects (see Bellavance et al. 2018 and Garrett et al. 2021a for details). We collected the content of each trap on every visit to a farm (i.e., every other day) and conserved arthropods in 70% ethanol until processing. We sorted samples by removing arthropods unlikely to be preyed upon by tree swallows (i.e., bumble bees (<i>Bombus</i> spp.: Hymenoptera), June bugs (<i>Phyllophaga</i> spp.: Coleoptera), large spiders (Araneae, &gt; 0.5 cm body width), and caterpillars (Lepidoptera); Bellavance et al. 2018).

<p><u>Conspecific social information</u></p>

<p>We defined two sources of social information regarding the future breeding success that an individual could expect to experience on a given farm: the density of tree swallows that bred on a farm during the previous year and the mean number of fledglings obtained by those breeders.</p>

<p>†</p> <p>Animals are expected to select a breeding habitat using cues that should reflect, directly or not, the fitness outcome of the different habitat options. However, human-induced environmental changes can alter the relationships between habitat characteristics and their fitness consequences, leading to maladaptive habitat choices. The most severe case of such nonideal habitat selection is the ecological trap, which occurs when individuals prefer to settle in poor-quality habitats while better ones are available. Here we studied the adaptiveness of nest box selection in a tree swallow (<i>Tachycineta bicolor</i>) population breeding over a 10-year period in a network of 400 nest boxes distributed along a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern QuÈbec, Canada. We first examined the effects of multiple environmental and social habitat characteristics on nest box preference to identify potential settlement cues. We then assessed the links between those cues and habitat quality as defined by the reproductive performance of individuals that settled early or late in nest boxes. We found that tree swallows preferred nesting in open habitats with high cover of perennial forage crops, high spring insect biomass, and high density of house sparrows (<i>Passer domesticus</i>), their main competitors for nest sites. They also preferred nesting where the density of breeders and their mean number of fledglings during the previous year were high. However, we detected mismatches between preference and habitat quality for several environmental variables. The density of competitors and conspecific social information showed severe mismatches, as their relationships to preference and breeding success went in opposite direction under certain circumstances. Spring food availability and agricultural landscape context, while related to preferences, were not related to breeding success. Overall, our study emphasizes the complexity of habitat selection behavior and provides evidence that multiple mechanisms may potentially lead to an ecological trap in farmlands.†</p> <p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Fonds de Recherche du QuÈbecóNature et technologies*<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p>  ",1,0,NA,yes,H,repository,.xlsx,sample coordinates,no,no,"Tachycineta bicolor, Passer domesticus",2009-2018,source link,10,source link,10200,source link,"abundance, presence-absence, density",,,,Authorea,,,I note the data type as abundance because of hatchling data

Y. Chang (Calycanthaceae), which has a unique systematic status, is listed as a national second-class protected plants of China . In this study, the genetic diversity, performance and fitness of F1 progeny from crosses between the Damingshan (DMS) population of <i>Sinocalycanthus chinensis</i> and pollen parents from the Daleishan (DLS) and Longxushan (LXS) populations were examined. The DLS population has a relatively small population size, low genetic diversity and considerable geographical and genetic distances from the DMS population relative to the LXS population. Compared with naturally occurring seeds, DLS-sired seeds had the highest thousand-seed weight, starch content, fat content, germination rate, germination index and emergence rate, but the lowest protein content. Naturally occurring, open pollinated seeds had the lowest thousand-seed weight, starch content and fat content, but the highest protein content. Compared with natural F1 progeny, DMS ◊ DLS seedlings had the highest genetic diversity, photosynthetic parameters and growth characteristics, except for leaf mass ratio and stem mass ratio. Under strong light, DMS ◊ DLS seedlings exhibited a <i>F</i>v/<i>F</i>m value of 0.75, while the other two seedling types exhibited <i>F</i>v/<i>F</i>m values of 0.65. DLS-sired seeds had the most vigorous growth characteristics except for leaf mass ratio and stem mass ratio. These results suggest that genetic rescue by transplanting seedlings from the DLS population or hand pollination with pollen from the DLS population would be effective methods to reduce inbreeding depression and obtain strong offspring with high genetic diversity and fitness in the DMS population.</p>","<p style=""text-align:justify;""><span><i>Pollen sources</i></span></p>

<p style=""text-indent:20.0pt;text-align:justify;""><span>Plants from two <i>S. chinensis</i> populations located at two sites with different population sizes, levels of genetic diversity and the relative geographical and genetic distances from the DMS seed parent were used as the pollen parents. One is located at Longxushan Mountain (LXS) in Anhui Province, China; this population is small with relatively high genetic diversity and with short geographical and low genetic distances from the DMS population (Table 1). This <i>S. chinensis </i>population is also within an evergreen broad-leaved forest. The main accompanying species are <i>Litsea coreana</i> var. <i>sinensis</i>, <i>Symplocos setchuensi </i>and <i>Platycarya strobilacea</i>. The other pollen parent population is located at Daleishan Mountain (DLS) in Tiantai County, Zhejiang Province, China, and it is a medium-sized population located a long geographical distance from the DMS population (Table 1). This <i>S. chinensis </i>population is located among shrubs within a valley. The main accompanying species are <i>Camellia cuspidate</i>, <i>Spiraea salicifolia</i>, <i>Corylopsis sinensis</i>, <i>Rhododendron simsii</i>, <i>Actinidia chinensis</i> and <i>Sargentodoxa cuneata</i>. The DLS <i>S. chinensis </i>plants occur in the canopy and are intertwined with<i> A. chinensis</i> and <i>S. cuneata</i>. </span></p>

<p style=""text-indent:20.0pt;text-align:justify;""><span>Mature <i>S. chinensis </i>plants were selected as pollen donors. In May 2009, when the stigmas of <i>S. chinensis</i> flowers in DMS had matured, pollens were collected from flowers on 20 mature <i>S. chinensis </i>individuals in the LXS and DLS populations using Chinese brushes and stored in sterile plastic tubes. The pollen samples were maintained at 4∞C and quickly transported to Damingshan Mountain, where the hand pollination was conducted with the DMS population. Pollen was transferred to DMS stigmas within 6 h. 30 mature individual plants in the DMS population were hand-pollinated with an average of 100 flowers per treatment. Each plant was randomly assigned to a crossing treatment and in total of 200 flowers were performed. All hand-pollinated stigmas were saturated with pollen. To exclude natural pollinators, plants were bagged with fine nylon mesh before flowering. Each hand-pollinated flower was also emasculated before the stigma became receptive to prevent selfing. Pollen was transferred directly from donor flower anthers onto receptive stigmas until the stigmas were saturated. The date was selected to ensure that each flower was encountered at the onset of its stigmatic surface receptivity. 30 naturally open pollinated DMS plants were selected as the control (Bossuyt, 2007; Holme, James &amp; Hoffmann, 2008). </span></p>

<p style=""text-indent:20.0pt;text-align:justify;""><span>In October 2009, <i>S. chinensis </i>fruits were collected and air dried, and seeds were collected from the dried fruits.

In August 2010, we conducted in-situ photosynthetic trait measurements on a sunny day using a mature middle leaflet at the same position across plants, using a GFS-3000 Portable Gas Exchange Fluorescence System (Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany). The photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was maintained at 800 ?mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> using a red-blue LED light source, and the temperature was maintained at 25∞C with a relative humidity of 70% inside the leaf measurement chamber.

The other pollen parent population is located at Daleishan Mountain (DLS) in Tiantai County, Zhejiang Province, China, and it is a medium-sized population located a long geographical distance from the DMS population (Table 1). This <i>S. chinensis </i>population is located among shrubs within a valley.

The pollen samples were maintained at 4∞C and quickly transported to Damingshan Mountain, where the hand pollination was conducted with the DMS population. Pollen was transferred to DMS stigmas within 6 h. 30 mature individual plants in the DMS population were hand-pollinated with an average of 100 flowers per treatment. Each plant was randomly assigned to a crossing treatment and in total of 200 flowers were performed. All hand-pollinated stigmas were saturated with pollen. To exclude natural pollinators, plants were bagged with fine nylon mesh before flowering. Each hand-pollinated flower was also emasculated before the stigma became receptive to prevent selfing. Pollen was transferred directly from donor flower anthers onto receptive stigmas until the stigmas were saturated. The date was selected to ensure that each flower was encountered at the onset of its stigmatic surface receptivity. 30 naturally open pollinated DMS plants were selected as the control (Bossuyt, 2007; Holme, James &amp; Hoffmann, 2008). </span></p>

Intersexual selection through female mate choice might be an important driver of the evolution of cognitive traits, especially in monogamous species, where females may obtain direct fitness benefits by choosing mates with better cognitive abilities. However, the importance given by females to male cognitive traits might vary among species and/or populations according to their life-history traits and ecology. To disentangle the effects of natural and sexual selection, here we use an agent-based simulation model and compare the model's predictions when females mate with the first randomly encountered male (i.e. under natural selection) versus when they choose among males based on their cognitive trait values (i.e. under natural and intersexual selection). Males and females are characterized, respectively, by their problem-solving ability and assessment strategy. At each generation, agents go through (1) a choosing phase during which females assess the cognitive abilities of potential mates until eventually finding an acceptable one, and (2) a reproductive phase during which all males compete for limited resources that are exploited at a rate which depends on their cognitive abilities. Because males provide paternal care, the foraging success of mated males determines the breeding success of the pair through its effect on nestling provisioning efficiency. The model predicts that intersexual selection plays a major role in most ecological conditions, by either reinforcing or acting against the effect of natural selection. The latter case occurs under harsh environmental conditions, where intersexual selection contributes to maintaining cognitive diversity.

The vast majority of animal species display range fidelity, a space-use behaviour enhancing familiarity with local habitat features. While the fitness benefits of this behaviour have been demonstrated in a variety of taxa, some species or populations rather display infidelity, displacing their home range over time. Others, such as many ungulate species, show seasonal adjustments in their range fidelity to accommodate changes in the dominance of limiting factors or in the distribution of resources. 2. Few empirical studies have explored the adaptive value of seasonal adjustments in range fidelity. Using boreal populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) as a biological model, we evaluated how range fidelity impacted individual performance during two seasons where juvenile and adult survival are limited by different predation pressures. 3. Between 2004 and 2013, we monitored the survival, reproductive success, habitat selection and range fidelity of female caribou in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. Using resource selection functions, we assessed how seasonal range fidelity was linked to two fitness correlates: calf survival in summer and adult female survival in winter. 4. Females displayed season-specific space use tactics: they selected previously used areas during calving and summer, but tended to shift their winter range from one year to the next. During calving and summer, range fidelity yielded relatively high fitness benefits, as females that did not lose their calf displayed stronger fidelity than females that did. In winter, however, adult survival was negatively linked to range fidelity, as females that survived selected areas further away from their seasonal range of the previous year than females that died. 5. We provide one of the first evidences that making seasonal adjustments in range fidelity can be an adaptive behaviour influencing the spatial distribution of a threatened species. Assessing the seasonal nature of range fidelity tactics may improve our predictions of space use and associated fitness implications for species displaying this behaviour.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">summer_base<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used in the resource selection function analysis linking habitat selection to range fidelity and calf survival in calving and summer.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">winter_base<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used in the resource selection function analysis linking habitat selection to range fidelity and adult female survival during winter.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",site fidelity; familiarity; Caribou; resource selection; spatial memory; calf; Rangifer tarandus caribou; range fidelity; reproductive success,Canada; QuÈbec,2018-01-19,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12645,6,zenodo,"Data from: Many places called home: the adaptive value of seasonal adjustments in range fidelity  1.

Using resource selection functions, we assessed how seasonal range fidelity was linked to two fitness correlates: calf survival in summer and adult female survival in winter. 4. Females displayed season-specific space use tactics: they selected previously used areas during calving and summer, but tended to shift their winter range from one year to the next. During calving and summer, range fidelity yielded relatively high fitness benefits, as females that did not lose their calf displayed stronger fidelity than females that did. In winter, however, adult survival was negatively linked to range fidelity, as females that survived selected areas further away from their seasonal range of the previous year than females that died. 5. We provide one of the first evidences that making seasonal adjustments in range fidelity can be an adaptive behaviour influencing the spatial distribution of a threatened species. Assessing the seasonal nature of range fidelity tactics may improve our predictions of space use and associated fitness implications for species displaying this behaviour. <div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">summer_base<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used in the resource selection function analysis linking habitat selection to range fidelity and calf survival in calving and summer.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">winter_base<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used in the resource selection function analysis linking habitat selection to range fidelity and adult female survival during winter.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div> site fidelity; familiarity; Caribou; resource selection; spatial memory; calf; Rangifer tarandus caribou; range fidelity; reproductive success Canada; QuÈbec",1,0,NA,yes,H,repository,.txt,administrative unit,no,"Map, range coordinates",Rangifer tarandus caribou,2004-2013,source link,9,source link,357644,source publication text,presence-absence,,,,Journal of Animal Ecology,,,"Not sure if its presence-absence or presence-only.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.bvq83bk79,Genomic analyses of phenotypic differences between native and invasive populations of diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa),"<p>Invasive species represent excellent opportunities to study the evolutionary potential of traits important to success in novel environments. Although some ecologically-important traits have been identified in invasive species, little is typically known about the genetic mechanisms that underlie invasion success in non-model species. Here, we use a genome-wide association (GWAS) approach to identify the genetic basis of trait variation in the non-model, invasive, diffuse knapweed (<i>Centaurea diffusa </i>Lam.<i> </i>[Asteraceae]). To assist with this analysis, we have assembled the first draft genome reference and fully annotated plastome assembly for this species, and the one of the first from this large, weedy, genus, which is of major ecological and economic importance. We collected phenotype data from 372 individuals from four native and four invasive populations of <i>C. diffusa </i>grown in a common environment. Using these individuals, we produced reduced-representation genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) libraries and identified 7058 SNPs. We identify two SNPs associated with leaf width in these populations, a trait which significantly varies between native and invasive populations. In this rosette forming species, increased leaf width is a major component of increased biomass, a common trait in invasive plants correlated with increased fitness. Finally, we use annotations from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to identify 98 candidate genes that are near the associated SNPs and highlight several good candidates for leaf width variation.</p>","<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">Published in Turner, K.

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">Seed was collected from an individual in the native range of <i>C. diffusa</i> (TR001-1; Table S1). Seed from this collection was grown in a greenhouse at the University of British Columbia in 2009. Young leaf tissue was sampled from one progeny (TR001-1L) and stored at -80∞ C to be used for draft reference genome assembly. DNA was extracted from frozen tissue using a modified Qiagen DNeasy column-less protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Concentration and quality were verified by Nanodrop, Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and gel electrophoresis. A whole genome shotgun library for this individual was produced and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 100 bp paired-end sequencing (Genome Quebec).<span style=""background:white;""> This produced ~69 million reads and ~14 Gbp, for a sequencing depth of ~16X. Raw reads were quality trimmed and screened for sequencing artifacts using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014). </span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;""><span style=""background:white;"">To produce the plastome assembly, clean reads were aligned to the <i>Lactuca†sativa</i>†plastome (Timme et al., 2007) using BWA (</span>Li &amp; Durbin, 2009<span style=""background:white;"">).

Visual inspection of the alignment revealed a few small indel and substitution errors, which were hand-corrected with Vim. A final alignment and inspection revealed no errors. </span>The plastome was annotated using DOGMA (Wyman et al., 2004) and validated for NCBI GenBank submission using Sequin 13.05. We used the blastn program (Altschul et al., 1997) to compare the gene content and sequence identity of the <i>C. diffusa</i> and <i>Cynara cardunculus</i> (GenBank: KP842711.1; Curci et al., 2016) plastid genomes. In order to calculate dN, dS, and dN/dS in protein coding regions, we made multiple alignments of the amino acid sequences using Muscle v3.8.31 (Edgar, 2004) and back translated them to codons (Grassa &amp; Kulathinal, 2011). <i>Lactuca sativa</i> plastid genes (GenBank: NC_007578.1; Kanamoto et al., 2004) were also included in the analysis of protein-coding regions. We used the yn00 method (Yang &amp; Nielsen, 2000) in PAML v4.8a (Yang, 2007) to calculate dN, dS, and dN/dS values on the aligned codons.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">An additional assembly was made to target the nuclear genome albeit at low depth. Unfiltered trimmed reads were assembled with Megahit (Li et al., 2015). Megahit contigs were repeat masked using Red (Girgis, 2015) and aligned to the Globe Artichoke reference genome (Scaglione et al., 2015) using Blastn (Altschul et al., 1990). These alignments were used as input to Chromosomer (Tamazian et al., 2016), which scaffolds contigs based on the order of homologous regions in a more completely assembled reference genome. Unplaced Megahit contigs were added to the output of Chromosomer to make a reference nuclear sequence. Finally, we polished the pseudomolecules with six iterations of Pilon (Walker et al., 2014) to fix local errors.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">The reference nuclear sequence was annotated for putative protein-coding genes using three types of evidence: <i>ab initio</i> Hidden Markov Model-based predictions, protein homology, and expressed sequence tags. <i>Ab initio predictions</i> were made using Augustus (Stanke et al., 2006) with the gene model trained for tomato (the phylogenetically closest model available at the time of analysis). Viridiplantae proteins were downloaded from RefSeq (O'Leary et al., 2016) and clustered at 90% identity with CD-HIT (Fu et al., 2012). Representative peptide sequences were first aligned to the nuclear reference with the Diamond (Buchfink et al., 2015) in sensitive mode to quickly identify candidate regions with sequence homology to known proteins. Peptides were realigned to the nuclear sequence at candidate loci using the more sensitive, but longer running, AAT (Huang et al., 1997). Assembled ESTs from a native (TR001-1L; the same individual used for this reference assembly) and invasive (US022-31E) genotype (Lai et al., 2012) were aligned with GMAP (Wu et al., 2016). The three lines of evidence were combined using Evidence Modeler (Haas et al., 2008) to generate the gene coordinates.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;""><i>Genome-wide association study</i></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">Seeds were collected as part of a broad collaborative effort from four native range and four invaded range <i>C. diffusa</i> populations (Fig 1; Table S1). Field collection took place between 2006 ñ 2008. Because maternal environmental effects can have strong, even adaptive, impacts on offspring phenotype in some systems (Galloway, 2005), we used individuals grown for two generations in a common environment to reduce maternal effects in this study. Specifically, field collected seed from these populations were raised in a greenhouse and crossed within populations (as previously reported in Turner et al., 2014). The seeds produced by those crosses were raised in a benign control environment, provided with ample resources, and phenotyped (as reported in Turner et al., 2014). Briefly, the 381 <i>C. diffusa </i>individuals included in this study were phenotyped as follows: Basal leaf number and length and width of the longest basal leaf for each individual was assessed three times during the experiment: beginning 7 wks after germination (at the mean 15 leaf stage), 10 wks after germination, and at harvest, and the maximum value was noted. At the end of the experiment, 19-20 wks after germination, the diameter at the interface between root and stem was assessed. In addition, two or three young leaves were sampled for DNA extraction and stored at -80 C, and one mature leaf was harvested to measure specific leaf area (SLA). Leaves for SLA were scanned and area measured using ImageJ 1.45s (Rasband, 2011) then dried at 29∞ C and weighed. The rest of the above ground biomass was harvested, dried, and weighed. These phenotypes were summarized into the following values for use in the GWAS analysis: (1) maximum leaf count, (2) maximum leaf width, (3) maximum leaf length, (4) root crown diameter, (5) shoot mass, and (6) SLA.</p>

<p class=""Normal1"" style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">To genotype individuals, DNA was extracted from young leaves using a Qiagen DNeasy 96 Plant Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and assessed for quantity using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). High quality DNA from 381 individuals was used to produce PstI-MspI genotype-by-sequencing libraries using a modified version of the protocol described in Poland et al. (2012). Briefly, we treated genomic DNA with HF-PstI and MspI at 37 ∞C for 5 hours. We ligated barcoded adaptors and barcoded common Y-shaped adaptors (Poland et al., 2012) to digested DNA at 22 ∞C for 3 hours. <a name=""-224122801_article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5""></a>We pooled groups of 96 ligated samples, which were then purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP system and amplified by PCR using KAPPA HiFi Hotstart master mix. Finally, we selected DNA fragments between 300-500 bp using the Agencourt AMPure XP system for paired-end 100bp sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Sequencing runs resulted in ~402 million reads passing initial quality control at the sequencing facility, with an average quality score of 36.</p>

<p class=""Normal1"" style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">Raw sequencing reads were de-multiplexed and data for each individual from all lanes were concatenated. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were called against the assembled reference sequence using dDocent v2.6.0 (Puritz et al., 2014). dDocent combines several existing software packages into a single pipeline designed specifically for paired-end GBS/RAD data and takes advantage of both forward and reverse reads for SNP discovery. SNPs were called based on a larger set of <i>Centaurea</i> individuals, including the 381 GWAS set and 54 individuals from additional populations. Then, using the individuals in this GWAS study only, SNPs were filtered for quality and missing data. The resulting variant call file (VCF) was filtered using vcftools v0.1.15 (Danecek et al., 2011) to a minimum quality score of 30, a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 5%, retaining individuals with no more than 40% missing data, and sites missing in no more than 10% of individuals with a minimum mean depth value greater than 20. Complex variants (multinucleotide polymorphisms and composite insertions and substitutions) were decomposed into SNP and indel representation following Puritz et al. (2014), retaining only one biallelic SNP per locus. Further filtering steps were performed to remove SNPs likely to be the result of sequencing errors, paralogs, multicopy loci or artifacts of library preparation (Methods S1). We concatenated SNPs found on unplaced scaffolds onto a single contig for analysis, and, because most GWAS analyses do not tolerate missing data, we replaced unknown genotypes with heterozygous calls. Using only SNPs without any missing data substantially decreases the number of SNPs that we could test but did not affect our results. The final data set used in downstream analyses consisted of 7058 SNPs found in 372 individuals from eight populations represented by 6-169 individuals (Fig. 1; Table S1).</p>

<p class=""Normal1"" style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">We used compressed mixed linear models (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v42/n4/full/ng.546.html"" target=""_blank""><span>Zhang et al., 2010</span></a>) implemented in GAPIT (Lipka et al., 2012) to test for associations between SNPs and our phenotypes. To avoid spurious associations and account for relatedness between our individuals, our models included a kinship matrix, which was calculated using the default settings for the VanRaden (2008) algorithm. This kinship matrix was validated against the known pedigree for these individuals from the greenhouse crossing design, and our results were not affected by using alternative ways to account for relatedness. To further account for population structure in our population, we used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC)-based model selection procedure implemented in GAPIT to determine the optimal number of principal components to include in our models (up to a maximum of 30) in addition to the calculated kinship matrix.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">We searched for genes near significant GWAS hits to gain insight as to what the genetic basis of these traits might be. For each significant GWAS hit we focused on genes located within 500kb in both the upstream and downstream direction; this marked the boundaries for the gene search. Genes identified in this way were functionally annotated based on sequence similarity to <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> using all-against-all BLASTP reciprocal best hits to ESTs in the TAIR 10 database (TAIR, 2020; Berardini et al. 2015). These TAIR 10 loci and associated Gene Ontology terms are reported.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">Finally, we put these results in the context of previous work on invasive candidate traits in this system. We determined whether significant GWAS hits were associated with traits that significantly varied between individuals from the native and invasive ranges in previous studies (Turner et al., 2014) and may be candidate invasiveness traits. We used linear mixed effect models in the R package lme4 (R version 3.5; R Core Team, 2018; Bates et al., 2014) and Fisher's exact tests to interrogate the relationships between range (native or invasive), genotypes, and traits. We further assessed overlap between SNPs and genes identified here and previous transcriptomic and gene expression work in this system (Lai et al., 2012; Hodgins et al., 2015; Turner et al., 2017).</p>","<p>centaurea_final_assembly.tgz - Draft genome assembly and annotation of Centaurea diffusa individual, TR001_1L, from seed collected in Turkey (native range) in 2008.</p>

Briefly, we treated genomic DNA with HF-PstI and MspI at 37 ∞C for 5 hours. We ligated barcoded adaptors and barcoded common Y-shaped adaptors (Poland et al., 2012) to digested DNA at 22 ∞C for 3 hours. <a name=""-224122801_article1.body1.sec2.sec3.p5""></a>We pooled groups of 96 ligated samples, which were then purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP system and amplified by PCR using KAPPA HiFi Hotstart master mix. Finally, we selected DNA fragments between 300-500 bp using the Agencourt AMPure XP system for paired-end 100bp sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Sequencing runs resulted in ~402 million reads passing initial quality control at the sequencing facility, with an average quality score of 36.</p>

<p class=""Normal1"" style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">Raw sequencing reads were de-multiplexed and data for each individual from all lanes were concatenated. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were called against the assembled reference sequence using dDocent v2.6.0 (Puritz et al., 2014). dDocent combines several existing software packages into a single pipeline designed specifically for paired-end GBS/RAD data and takes advantage of both forward and reverse reads for SNP discovery. SNPs were called based on a larger set of <i>Centaurea</i> individuals, including the 381 GWAS set and 54 individuals from additional populations. Then, using the individuals in this GWAS study only, SNPs were filtered for quality and missing data. The resulting variant call file (VCF) was filtered using vcftools v0.1.15 (Danecek et al., 2011) to a minimum quality score of 30, a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 5%, retaining individuals with no more than 40% missing data, and sites missing in no more than 10% of individuals with a minimum mean depth value greater than 20. Complex variants (multinucleotide polymorphisms and composite insertions and substitutions) were decomposed into SNP and indel representation following Puritz et al. (2014), retaining only one biallelic SNP per locus. Further filtering steps were performed to remove SNPs likely to be the result of sequencing errors, paralogs, multicopy loci or artifacts of library preparation (Methods S1). We concatenated SNPs found on unplaced scaffolds onto a single contig for analysis, and, because most GWAS analyses do not tolerate missing data, we replaced unknown genotypes with heterozygous calls. Using only SNPs without any missing data substantially decreases the number of SNPs that we could test but did not affect our results. The final data set used in downstream analyses consisted of 7058 SNPs found in 372 individuals from eight populations represented by 6-169 individuals (Fig. 1; Table S1).</p>

<p class=""Normal1"" style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">We used compressed mixed linear models (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v42/n4/full/ng.546.html"" target=""_blank""><span>Zhang et al., 2010</span></a>) implemented in GAPIT (Lipka et al., 2012) to test for associations between SNPs and our phenotypes. To avoid spurious associations and account for relatedness between our individuals, our models included a kinship matrix, which was calculated using the default settings for the VanRaden (2008) algorithm. This kinship matrix was validated against the known pedigree for these individuals from the greenhouse crossing design, and our results were not affected by using alternative ways to account for relatedness. To further account for population structure in our population, we used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC)-based model selection procedure implemented in GAPIT to determine the optimal number of principal components to include in our models (up to a maximum of 30) in addition to the calculated kinship matrix.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">We searched for genes near significant GWAS hits to gain insight as to what the genetic basis of these traits might be. For each significant GWAS hit we focused on genes located within 500kb in both the upstream and downstream direction; this marked the boundaries for the gene search. Genes identified in this way were functionally annotated based on sequence similarity to <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> using all-against-all BLASTP reciprocal best hits to ESTs in the TAIR 10 database (TAIR, 2020; Berardini et al. 2015). These TAIR 10 loci and associated Gene Ontology terms are reported.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;"">Finally, we put these results in the context of previous work on invasive candidate traits in this system. We determined whether significant GWAS hits were associated with traits that significantly varied between individuals from the native and invasive ranges in previous studies (Turner et al., 2014) and may be candidate invasiveness traits. We used linear mixed effect models in the R package lme4 (R version 3.5; R Core Team, 2018; Bates et al., 2014) and Fisher's exact tests to interrogate the relationships between range (native or invasive), genotypes, and traits. We further assessed overlap between SNPs and genes identified here and previous transcriptomic and gene expression work in this system (Lai et al., 2012; Hodgins et al., 2015; Turner et al., 2017).</p> <p>Invasive species represent excellent opportunities to study the evolutionary potential of traits important to success in novel environments. Although some ecologically-important traits have been identified in invasive species, little is typically known about the genetic mechanisms that underlie invasion success in non-model species. Here, we use a genome-wide association (GWAS) approach to identify the genetic basis of trait variation in the non-model, invasive, diffuse knapweed (<i>Centaurea diffusa </i>Lam.<i> </i>[Asteraceae]). To assist with this analysis, we have assembled the first draft genome reference and fully annotated plastome assembly for this species, and the one of the first from this large, weedy, genus, which is of major ecological and economic importance. We collected phenotype data from 372 individuals from four native and four invasive populations of <i>C. diffusa </i>grown in a common environment. Using these individuals, we produced reduced-representation genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) libraries and identified 7058 SNPs. We identify two SNPs associated with leaf width in these populations, a trait which significantly varies between native and invasive populations. In this rosette forming species, increased leaf width is a major component of increased biomass, a common trait in invasive plants correlated with increased fitness. Finally, we use annotations from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to identify 98 candidate genes that are near the associated SNPs and highlight several good candidates for leaf width variation.</p> <p>centaurea_final_assembly.tgz - Draft genome assembly and annotation of Centaurea diffusa individual, TR001_1L, from seed collected in Turkey (native range) in 2008.</p>

<p>In this study, we evaluated the temporal changes in the combined impact of two stressors, one constant (collar-marking) and another one variable over time (hunting intensity), in greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlantica). Over a 30-year period (1990-2019), hunting regulations were liberalized twice, in 1999 and 2009, with the instauration of special spring and winter hunting seasons, respectively. We evaluated the effect of collars on goose survival through this period of changing hunting regulations. We compared annual survival of &gt;20,000 adult females marked with and without neck collars using multievent capture-recapture models, and partitioned hunting from non-hunting mortality.</p>
<p>Survival of geese marked with or without collars was similar in 1990-1998, before hunting regulations were liberalized (average survival[95% C.I.]: 0.87[0.84, 0.89]). However, absolute survival of collared geese was 0.05[0.03, 0.07] lower than that of non-collared geese between 1999 and 2009, and 0.12[0.09, 0.15] lower after hunting regulations were liberalized further in 2009. Hunting and non-hunting mortality were both higher in collared birds compared to those without collars.</p>
<p>The interaction between the effects of collars and hunting was synergistic because collars affected survival only after the hunting pressure increased significantly. These cumulated stresses probably reduced goose body condition sufficiently to increase their vulnerability to multiple sources of mortality.</p>
<p>Synthesis and applications: Researchers relying on long-term marking programs should evaluate the effect of markers periodically rather than solely in the beginning, as interactions with changing environmental conditions may eventually affect conclusions of studies based on marked animals. Here, we provide a rare demonstration in a natural setting that a combination of stressors can push animals beyond a threshold where vital rates are affected, even when one stressor applied alone initially had no detectable impact.</p>","<p>Dataset A: Individual Capture histories</p>

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9tf3hr5,Data from: Body shape is related to attempt rate and passage success of brook trout at in-stream barriers,"1.	The ability to move between habitats has important implications for fitness in many species. In-stream barriers such as culverts can impede movements of riverine fishes and thus reduce connectivity between habitats. The ability of fish to overcome barriers is related to the features of the environment and the barrier itself, but also to physiological, morphological, and behavioural traits of the fish. Among these, body shape varies among and within species and influences swimming ability, a key component of passage performance through culverts.
2.	We conducted an experimental study on wild brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) to assess the effects of individual body shape on attempt rate and passage success through culverts on six streams.
3.	A more streamlined body shape was associated with an increased motivation to enter and ascend the culverts, and, to a lesser extent, with the probability of successful passage once an attempt was staged. Motivation and successful passage were also influenced by the density of conspecifics below the culvert, time of day, fish body size, and water velocity.
4.	 Policy implications
While fish body shape is expected to influence swimming performance, our research shows the most important effect of body shape to be on an individual's motivation to stage passage attempts at culverts. This study points to an important connection between behaviour and morphological traits that influence passage success and suggests that in-stream barriers may be an important agent of selection on behavior and morphology in wild fish populations.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Goerigetal_BodyShapeCulvertPassage<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This data package allows reproducing all analysis and figures included in the article.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8kprr4xs0,Data from: Hedging at the rear edge: Intraspecific trait variability drives the trajectory of marginal populations in a widespread boreal tree species,"<p>Rear-edge populations at the warm margin of species distribution are small, isolated and face environmental conditions at the limit of species bioclimatic envelope. Intraspecific phenotypic variation contributing to the persistence of peripheral populations is expected to become increasingly important under future climate conditions in order to avoid local extirpation where range shifts lag behind climate change velocity.</p>
<p>We investigated the putative role of intraspecific phenotypic variation for the maintenance of rear-edge populations of fire-prone jack pine (<em>Pinus banksiana</em>), an obligate pyriscent boreal species. We assessed whether variation in cone serotiny is associated with the population trajectory of marginal stands located south of the boreal biome, in the temperate forest where natural wildfires are infrequent and unpredictable. To this end, we estimated stand-scale serotiny, minimal age and tree size structure in 26 jack pine stands from the rear edge (n = 17 sites) and the core (n = 9 sites) of the species' range in eastern Canada.</p>
<p>On average, rear-edge jack pine populations are less serotinous albeit more variably compared to range-core populations where serotiny is more uniformly high. Rear-edge stands are generally older and display reverse J-shape tree size structure indicative of a multi-aged demographic equilibrium, whereas range-core stands are younger and show a unimodal stand structure depicting a single aging cohort generally lacking interfire recruitment. Eco-evolutionary dynamics shifts from a dependency on wildfires in range-core populations to stands that can regenerate and persist without recurrent fires at the rear edge, where stand-scale serotiny reaches values below 85%.</p>
<p>Synthesis: Unlike range-core populations, rear-edge jack pine populations can locally rely on a dual life-history strategy to ensure both steady recruitment during fire-free intervals and successful postfire regeneration. This capacity to cope with infrequent and unpredictable fire regime should increase the resilience and resistance of jack pine populations as global changes alter fire dynamics of the boreal forest. More generally, unique intraspecific phenotypic variation in rear-edge populations contributes to long-term species persistence in marginal environmental conditions that might scale up with global changes.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3275s,Data from: Do temperate tree species diversity and identity influence soil microbial community function and composition?,"Studies of biodiversity-ecosystem function in treed ecosystems have generally focused on aboveground functions. The present study investigates inter-trophic links between tree diversity and soil microbial community function and composition.We examined how microbial communities in surface mineral soil responded to experimental gradients of tree species richness (SR), functional diversity (FD), community-weighted mean trait value (CWM) and tree identity. The site was a 4-yr-old common garden experiment near Montreal, Canada, consisting of deciduous and evergreen tree species mixtures.

	<li>Although grazing has significant impacts on plant functional traits and community composition in grasslands, few studies have simultaneously explored how plant above- and below-ground traits and community functional composition respond to grazing.</li>
	<li>Using a grazing manipulation experiment with seven levels of grazing intensity (0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, 7.5, and 9 sheep ha<sup>-1</sup>) in the Inner Mongolia grassland, we partitioned the roles of intraspecific trait variation (ITV) and species turnover underlying the grazing induced changes in above- and below-ground functional trait composition of plant communities.† Six aboveground traits (i.e. plant height, plant aboveground biomass, plant density, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf density) and three root traits (average root diameter, ARD; specific root length, SRL; and root tissue density, RTD) of the first-, second- and third-order roots (1<sup>st</sup>-, 2<sup>nd</sup>-, and 3<sup>rd</sup>-) were measured at the plant individual level.†</li>
	<li>At the community level, plant above-ground traits shifted towards grazing avoidance strategy (e.g. plant height and leaf area decreased), and below-ground traits shifted towards conservative strategy (i.e. 1<sup>st</sup>-SRL and 2<sup>nd</sup>-SRL decreased, 1<sup>st</sup>-RTD and 2<sup>nd</sup>-ARD increased) with increasing grazing intensity. †Functional tradeoffs were found between plant individual biomass and plant density, and between leaf area and leaf density under grazing. †However, community-weighted mean SRL (SRL<sub>CWM</sub>) and ARD (ARD<sub>CWM</sub>) of different root orders exhibited functional coordination under grazing pressure. †SLA<sub>CWM</sub> and SRL<sub>CWM</sub> also showed synergistic responses to grazing.</li>
	<li>†The ITV plays a predominant for the changes in above- and below-ground functional trait composition at the community level.† However, changes in mean trait values among plant species with different resource use strategies were mainly triggered by species turnover.† For species with different resource use strategies, grazing exhibited a coordinated effects on ITV but an offset effect on species turnover.</li>
	<li>

https://doi.org/10.5068/D19H5X,Data for: Dorsal premammillary projection to periaqueductal gray controls escape vigor from innate and conditioned threats,"<p>Escape from threats has paramount importance for survival. However, it is unknown if a single circuit controls escape from innate and conditioned threats. The hypothalamic dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) may control escape, as it is strongly activated by escape-inducing threats and projects to the region most implicated in escape, the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG). We show that in mice cholecystokinin (cck)-expressing PMd cells are activated during escape, but not other defensive behaviors. PMd-cck ensemble activity can also predict future escape. Furthermore, PMd inhibition decreases escape speed from both innate and conditioned threats. Inhibition of the PMd-cck projection to the dlPAG also decreased escape speed. Lastly, human fMRI data show that a posterior hypothalamic-to-dlPAG pathway increases activity during exposure to aversive images, indicating that a similar pathway may possibly have a related role in humans. Our data identify the PMd as a central node of the escape network.</p>","<p>All procedures conformed to guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health and have been approved by the University of California, Los Angeles Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or by the University of Sao Paulo Animal Bioethics committee.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Surgeries.</b> Surgeries were performed as described previously <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/LIUxf""><span>(Adhikari et al., 2015)</span></a>. Eight-week-old mice were anaesthetized with 1.5-3.0% isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf Instruments). A scalpel was used to open an incision along the midline to expose the skull. After performing a craniotomy, 40 nl of one of the viral vectors listed above at a titer of 2*1012 particles/ml was injected per site (PMd, amv dlPAG) using a 10 ?l nanofil syringe (World Precision Instruments) at 0.08 ?l/min. The syringe was coupled to a 33-gauge beveled needle, and the bevel was placed to face the anterior side of the animal. The syringe was slowly retracted 20 minutes after the start of the infusion. Mice received unilateral viral infusion and fiber optic cannula implantation. Infusion locations measured as anterior-posterior, medial-lateral and dorso-ventral coordinates from bregma were: dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) (-4.75, -0.45, -1.9), dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) (-2.46, -0.5, -5.35) and anteromedial ventral thalamus (amv) (-0.85, -0.5, -3.9). For optogenetic experiments, fiber optic cannula (0.22 NA, 200 ?m diameter; Newdoon) were implanted bilaterally 0.15 mm above the viral infusion sites. Only mice with viral expression restricted to the intended targets were used for behavioral assays.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">For photometry experiments mice were injected with 0.16 uL at a titer of 3*10<sup>12</sup> of AAV9.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 in the PMd of cck-cre mice. The same volume and titer of AAV9.Syn.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 was injected into the dlPAG or amv.† Mice were implanted unilaterally with fiberoptic cannulae in the PMd, amv dlPAG. A 400 ?m diameter, 0.48 NA optical fiber (Neurophotometrics) was used for photometry experiments. Adhesive cement (C&amp;B metabond; Parkell, Edgewood, NY, USA) and dental cement (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) were used to securely attach the fiber optic cannula to the skull. For miniaturized microscope experiments 40 nL of AAV9-DIO-GCaMP6s was injected in the PMd of cck-cre mice and a 7mm GRIN lens was implanted 200 uM above the infusion site. Three weeks following surgery animals were base-plated.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Rat Exposure Assay. </b>Mice were accustomed to handling prior to any behavioral assay. On day 1, mice were habituated to a white rectangular box (70 cm length, 26 cm width, 44 cm height) for 20 minutes. Twenty-four hours later, mice were exposed to the same environment but in the presence of a toy rat for 20 minutes. Mice were then exposed to an adult rat or a toy rat in this environment on the two following days. The rat was secured by a harness tied to one of the walls and could freely ambulate only within a short radius of approximately 20 cm. The mouse was placed near the wall opposite to the rat and freely explored the context for 20 minutes. No separating barrier was placed between the mouse and the rat, allowing for close naturalistic encounters that can induce a variety of robust defensive behaviors.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Contextual Fear Conditioning Test. </b>To better evaluate a broader species-specific defense repertoire in face of a conditioned stimulus, we used a modified version of the standard contextual fear conditioning method <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/PEmIx""><span>(Schuette et al., 2020)</span></a>. Pre-shock, fear conditioning and retrieval sessions were performed in a context (70 cm x 17 cm x 40 cm) with an evenly distributed light intensity of 40 lux and a Coulbourn shock grid (19.5 cm x 17 cm) set at the extreme end of the enclosure. Forty-eight hours after rat exposure, mice were habituated to this context and could freely explore the whole environment for 20 minutes. On the following day, the grid was activated, such that a single 0.7 mA foot shock was delivered for 2 seconds only on the first time the mouse fully entered the grid zone. Twenty-four hours later, retrieval sessions were performed in the same enclosure but without shock. Mice could freely explore the context for 20 minutes during pre-shock habituation, fear conditioning and retrieval sessions.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Behavioral quantification.</b> To extract the pose of freely-behaving mice in the described assays, we implemented DeepLabCut <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/KEP6V""><span>(Nath et al., 2019)</span></a>, an open-source convolutional neural network-based toolbox, to identify mouse nose, ear and tailbase xy-coordinates in each recorded video frame. These coordinates were then used to calculate velocity and position at each timepoint, as well as classify behaviors such as escape runs and freezes in an automated manner using custom Matlab scripts. Specifically:</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">'Escapes' were defined as epochs for which (1) the mouse speed away from the rat or toy rat exceeded 2 cm/s. As there was little room for acceleration between the rat and opposite wall, the speed threshold was set to this relatively low value.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">'Stretch-attend postures' were defined as epochs for which (1) the distance between mouse nose and tailbase exceeded a distance of approximately 1.2 mouse body lengths and (2) mouse tailbase speed fell below 1 cm/s.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">'Freezes' were defined as periods for which mouse nose and tailbase speed fell below 0.25 cm/s for at least 0.33s <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/PEmIx""><span>(Schuette et al., 2020)</span></a>.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">All behaviors were manually checked by the experimenters for error.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Fiber photometry. </b>Photometry was performed as described in detail previously <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/YkWEz""><span>(Kim et al., 2016)</span></a>. Briefly, we used a 405-nm LED and a 470-nm LED (Thorlabs, M405F1 and M470F1) for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>independent isosbestic control measurements. The two LEDs were bandpass filtered (Thorlabs, FB410-10 and FB470-10) and then combined with a 425-nm longpass dichroic mirror (Thorlabs, DMLP425R) and coupled into the microscope using a 495-nm longpass dichroic mirror (Semrock, FF495-Di02-25 ◊36). Mice were connected with a branched patch cord (400 ?m, Doric Lenses, Quebec, Canada) using a zirconia sleeve to the optical system. The signal was captured at 20 Hz (alternating 405-nm LED and 470-nm LED). To correct for signal artifacts of a non biological origin (i.e. photobleaching and movement artifacts), custom Matlab scripts leveraged the reference signal (405-nm), unaffected by calcium saturation, to isolate and remove these effects from the calcium signal (470-nm).</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Fiber Photometry behavior-triggered averaging.</b> To plot the behavior-triggered averages, only mice that displayed a minimum of three behavioral instances were included in the corresponding behavioral figure.</p>

They were then temporally downsampled by a factor of four and spatially downsampled by a factor of two. The cell activity and footprints were extracted using the open-source package Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for microEndoscopic data (CNMF-E; <a href=""https://github.com/zhoupc/CNMF_E""><span>https://github.com/zhoupc/CNMF_E</span></a>) <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/hwz1e+PEmIx""><span>(Schuette et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2018)</span></a>. Only cells whose variance was greater than or equal to 25<span style=""background:white;"">% of the maximum </span>variance<span style=""background:white;""> among non-outliers were used in the analysis.</span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;text-align:justify;""><b><span lang=""EN"" style=""background:white;"">Behavior decoding using PMd neural data.</span></b><span lang=""EN"" style=""background:white;""> Discrete classification of escape behavior was performed using multinomial logistic regression. Timepoints following escape by 2 seconds were labelled 'escape,' and a matched number of non-escape timepoints were randomly selected for training and validation. Each time point was treated as an individual data point. Training and validation were performed using 5-fold cross-validation, with a minimum of 10 seconds between training and validation sets. As equal numbers of escape and non-escape samples were used to build the training and validation sets, chance accuracy was 50%. Sessions with less than 5 escapes were excluded from the analysis. The same analysis was performed for approach, stretch-attend postures, and freeze. To predict escape at negative time lags from behavior onset, the same analysis procedure was implemented, using 2-second epochs preceding escape by 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 seconds.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Behavior cell classification.</b> We used a generalized linear model (GLM) to identify cells that showed increased calcium activity during approach, stretch-attend, escape and freeze behaviors. We fit this model to each cell's activity, with behavior indices as the predictor variable and behavior coefficients as the measure of fit. Behavior onset times were then randomized 100 times and a bootstrap distribution built from the resulting GLM coefficients. A cell was considered a behavior-categorized cell if its coefficient exceeded 95% of the bootstrap coefficient values.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Position and speed decoding. </b>To predict position and speed from neural data, these data had their dimensionality reduced by principal component analysis, such that the top principal components, representing at least 80% of the total variance, were used in the following decoding analysis. This output and the related position/speed data were then separated into alternating 60s training and testing blocks, with 10s of separation between blocks. Even blocks were used to train a generalized linear regression model (GLM; Matlab function 'glmfit') and withheld odd blocks were used to test the resulting model.† Accuracies of this withheld testing block were reported as mean squared error.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Chemogenetics. </b>Mice used for chemogenetic experiments were exposed to each threat and control stimuli twice, once following treatment with saline and once following treatment with CNO (5 mg/kg, injected intraperitoneally) 40 minutes prior to the experiment. Only one control or threat-exposure assay was performed per day with each mouse.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Behavior video capture. </b>All behavior videos were captured at 30 frames/sec in standard definition (640x480) using a Logitech HD C310 webcam. To capture fiber-photometry synchronized videos, both the calcium signal and behavior were recorded by the same computer using custom Matlab scripts that also collected timestamp values for each calcium sample/behavioral frame. These timestamps were used to precisely align neural activity and behavior.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Light Delivery for optogenetics.</b> For PMd-cck ChR2 mice, blue light was generated by a 473 nm laser (Dragon Lasers, Changchun Jilin, China) at 4.5 mW unless otherwise indicated. Green light was generated by a 532 nm laser (Dragon Lasers), and bilaterally delivered to mice at 10 mW. A Master-8 pulse generator (A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel) was used to drive the blue laser at 20 Hz. This stimulation pattern was used for all ChR2 experiments. The laser output was delivered to the animal via an optical fiber (200 ?m core, 0.22 numerical aperture, Doric Lenses, Canada) coupled to the fiberoptic implanted on the animals through a zirconia sleeve.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Immunostaining for cfos</b>. Fixed brains were kept in 30% sucrose at 4<sup>o</sup>C overnight, and then sectioned on a cryostat (40 µm) slices. Sections were washed in PBS and incubated in a blocking solution (3% normal donkey serum and 0.3% triton-x in PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were then incubated at 4oC for 12 hours with polyclonal anti-fos antibody made in rabbit (1/500 dilution) (c-Fos (9F6) Rabbit mAb CAT#2250, Cell Signalling Technology) in blocking solution. Following primary antibody incubation sections were washed in PBS 3 times for 10 minutes, and then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody (1/500 dilution) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (red) (CAT# 8889S, cellsignal.com) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were washed in PBS 3 times for 10 minutes, incubated with DAPI (1/50000 dilution in PBS), washed again in PBS and mounted in glass slides using PVA-DABCO (Sigma).</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Perfusion and histological verification.</b> Mice were anesthetized with Fatal-Plus and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline followed by a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde. Extracted brains were stored for 12 hs at 4∞C in 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were then placed in sucrose for a minimum of 24 hs. Brains were sectioned in the coronal plane in a cryostat, washed in phosphate buffered saline and mounted on glass slides using PVA-DABCO. Images were acquired using a Keyence BZ-X fluorescence microscope with a 10 or 20X air objective.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Acute brain slice preparation and electrophysiological recordings. </b>Cck-cre driver line mice were injected with AAV9-FLEX-ChR2-YFP in the PMd. Acute slices were prepared from these mie. For electrophysiological measurements, slices were transferred as needed to the recording chamber, where they were perfused with oxygenated aCSF at 32∞C. The slices were held in place using a nylon net stretched within a U-shaped platinum wire. Visually-guided whole cell patch clamp recordings were made using infrared differential interference contrast optics. We also verified the identity of PMD neurons by only recording from YFP-positive neurons. All recordings were obtained using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier system (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Experiments were controlled by PClamp 10 software running on a PC, and the data were acquired using the Digidata 1440A acquisition system. All recording electrodes (3-8 M?) were pulled from thin-walled capillary glass (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA) using a Sutter Instruments P97 puller. The patch pipettes were filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 100 K- gluconate, 20 KCl, 4 ATP-Mg, 10 phospho-creatine, 0.3 GTP-Na, and 10 HEPES (in mM) with a pH of 7.3 and osmolarity of 300 mOsm. Only cells with a stable, uncorrected resting membrane potential (RMP) between -50 to -80 mV, overshooting action potentials, and an input resistance (RN) &gt; 100 MW were used. To minimize the influence of voltage-dependent changes on membrane conductances, all cells were studied at a membrane potential near -60 mV (using constant current injection under current clamp mode). To study intrinsic firing properties of PMD neurons, WCRs were conducted under current clamp using the following protocol: (1) Voltageñcurrent (V-I) relations were obtained using 400 ms current steps (range -50 pA to rheobase) and by plotting the plateau voltage deflection against current amplitude. Neuronal input resistance (RN) was determined from the slope of the linear fit of that portion of the V-I plot where the voltage sweeps did not exhibit sags or active conductance. (2) Intrinsic excitability measurements were obtained using 1s current steps (range 0 to 500 pA) and by plotting the number of action potentials fired against current amplitude. (3) Resting membrane potential (RMP) was calculated as the difference between mean membrane potential during the first minute immediately after obtaining whole cell configuration and after withdrawing the electrode from the neuron.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">For validating hM4Di in PMd-cck cells, acute brain slices preparation and electrophysiological recordings were performed using standard methods as previously described <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/7UpM4""><span>(Nagai et al., 2019)</span></a>. Briefly, Cck-Cre+ mice that had received AAV microinjections into PMd were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated with sharp shears. The brains were placed and sliced in ice-cold modified artificial CSF (aCSF) containing the following (in mM): 194 sucrose, 30 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 NaH2PO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 D-glucose, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. A vibratome (DSK-Zero1) was used to cut 300 ?m brain sections. The slices were allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes at 32-34∞C in normal aCSF containing (in mM); 124 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 D-glucose continuously bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices were then stored at 21ñ23∞C in the same buffer until use. All slices were used within 2-6 hours of slicing.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Slices were placed in the recording chamber and continuously perfused with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> bubbled normal aCSF. pCLAMP10.4 software and a Multi-Clamp 700B amplifier was used for electrophysiology (Molecular Devices). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from neurons in the PMd or dorsolateral PAG (dlPAG) using patch pipettes with a typical resistance of 4ñ5 M?. Neurons were selected based on reporter fluorescence,(mCherry for hM4Di-mCherry). The intracellular solution for recordings comprised the following (in mM) : 135 potassium gluconate, 5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP and 0.3 Na-GTP, pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH. The initial access resistance values were &lt; 20 M? for all cells; if this changed by &gt; 20% the cell was discarded. Light flashes (0.2 mW/mm2) from a blue LED light source (Sutter Instruments) were delivered via the microscope optics and a 40x water immersion objective lens and controlled remotely using TTL pulses from Clampex. Cell responses were recorded in whole-cell mode and recorded using an Axopatch 700B amplifier connected via a digitizer to a computer with pCLAMP10 software. To stimulate ChR2 expressed in PMd neurons or axons, 5 ms pulses were delivered at inter-pulse intervals of 200 ms, 50 ms or 25 ms for 5, 20 or 40 Hz optical stimulations, respectively.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) methods</b></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>Participants. </b>This study included 48 adult participants (mean ± SD age: 25.1 ± 7.1; 27 male, 21 female; 7 left-handed; 40 white and 8 non-white (1 Hispanic, 5 Asian, 1 Black and 1 American Indian)). All participants were healthy, with normal or corrected to normal vision and normal hearing, and with no history of psychiatric, physiological or pain disorders and neurological conditions, no current pain symptoms and no MRI contraindications. Eligibility was assessed with a general health questionnaire, a pain safety screening form and an MRI safety screening form. Participants were recruited from the Boulder/Denver Metro Area. The institutional review board of the University of Colorado Boulder approved the study, and all participants provided written informed consent.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>Experimental Paradigm. </b>Participants received five different types of aversive stimulation (mechanical pain, thermal pain, aversive auditory, aversive visual, and pleasant visual), each at four stimulus intensities. 24 stimuli of each type (6 per intensity) were presented over six fMRI runs in random order. Following stimulation on each trial, participants made behavioral ratings of their subjective experience. Participants were instructed to answer the question 'How much do you want to avoid this experience in the future?'. Ratings were made with a non-linear visual analog rating scale, with anchors 'Not at all' and 'Most' displayed at the ends of the scale.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>Stimuli.</b> Visual stimulation<i> </i>was administered on the MRI screen and included normed images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/tVsid""><span>(Lang et al., 2008)</span></a>. To induce four 'stimulus intensity levels' we selected four groups of 7 images based on their†† normed aversiveness ratings (averaged across male and female raters) available in the IAPS database and confirmed by <i>N</i> = 10 lab members (5 male, 5 female) in response to 'How aversive is this image? 1-100'. Selected images included photographs of animals (n=7), bodily illness and injury (n=12), industrial and human waste (n=9). Four stimulus levels were delivered to participants for 10 sec each.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>MRI data acquisition and preprocessing.</b></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;"">Whole-brain fMRI data were acquired on a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma Fit MRI scanner at the Intermountain Neuroimaging Consortium facility at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Structural images were acquired using high-resolution T1 spoiled gradient recall images (SPGR) for anatomical localization and warping to standard MNI space. Functional images were acquired with a multiband EPI sequence (TR = 460 ms, TE = 27.2 ms, field of view = 220 mm, multiband acceleration factor = 8, flip angle = 44∞, 64 ◊ 64 image matrix, 2.7 mm isotropic voxels, 56 interleaved slices, phase encoding posterior &gt;&gt; anterior). Six runs of 7.17 mins duration (934 total measurements) were acquired. Stimulus presentation and behavioral data acquisition were controlled using Psychtoolbox.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;"">FMRI data were preprocessed using an automated pipeline implemented by the Mind Research Network, Albuquerque, NM. Briefly, the preprocessing steps included: distortion correction using FSL's top-up tool (<a href=""https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/topup""><span>https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/</span></a>), motion correction (affine alignment of first EPI volume (reference image) to T1, followed by affine alignment of all EPI volumes to the reference image and estimation of the motion parameter file (sepi_vr_motion.1D, AFNI,<a href=""https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/""> </a><a href=""https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/""><span>https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/</span></a>), spatial normalization via subject's T1 image (T1 normalization to MNI space (nonlinear transform), normalization of EPI image to MNI space (3dNWarpApply, AFNI, <a href=""https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/"">†</a><a href=""https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/""><span>https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/</span></a>), interpolation to 2 mm isotropic voxels and smoothing with a 6 mm FWHM kernel (SPM 8,<a href=""https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/""> </a><a href=""https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/"">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/</a>).</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;"">Prior to first level (within-subject) analysis, we removed the first four volumes to allow for image intensity stabilization. We also identified image-wise outliers by computing both the mean and the standard deviation (across voxels) of intensity values for each image for all slices to remove intermittent gradient and severe motion-related artifacts (spikes) that are present to some degree in all fMRI data.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>fMRI data analysis.</b> Data were analyzed using SPM12 (<a href=""http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm""><span>http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</span></a>) and custom MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) code available from the authors' website (<a href=""http://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore"">http://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore</a>). First-level general linear model (GLM) analyses were conducted in SPM12. The six runs were concatenated for each subject. Boxcar regressors, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function, were constructed to model periods for the 10-second stimulation and 4-7 second rating periods. The fixation cross epoch was used as an implicit baseline. A high-pass filter of 0.008 Hz was applied. Nuisance variables included (a) ""dummy"" regressors coding for each run (intercept for each run); (b) linear drift across time within each run; (c) the six estimated head movement parameters (x, y, z, roll, pitch, and yaw), their mean-centered squares, their derivatives, and squared derivative for each run (total 24 columns); and (d) motion outliers (spikes) identified in the previous step. A ""single-trial model"" was used to uniquely estimate the response to every stimulus in order to assess functional connectivity.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>Functional connectivity analysis. </b>Functional connectivity between the hypothalamus and PAG was estimated using Partial Least Squares (PLS) <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/YiPzJ""><span>(Wold et al., 2001)</span></a> regression, which identifies latent multivariate patterns that maximize the covariance between two blocks of data (i.e., BOLD activity in hypothalamus and PAG voxels). Here, data comprised single trial estimates of brain activation in response to aversive thermal, mechanical, auditory, and visual stimuli, in addition to a set of pleasant visual stimuli which were used as a control. For the PLS model, the predictor block of variables included all voxels in an anatomically defined mask of the hypothalamus <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/6iTFD""><span>(Pauli et al., 2018)</span></a> (337 voxels) and the outcome block included all voxels in the PAG <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/Ov9VY""><span>(Kragel et al., 2019)</span></a> (42 voxels). Localization of the hypothalamus signal that covaries with the PAG responses was performed by bootstrapping the PLS regression and examining the distribution of PLS regression coefficients and their deviation from zero (using normal approximation for inference). Hyperalignment of fMRI data <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/SXIFJ""><span>(Haxby et al., 2011)</span></a> was conducted separately for each region as a preprocessing step, and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was performed to estimate the strength of functional connections (i.e., the Pearson correlation between the first 'X score' and 'Y score' estimated by PLS, similar to the canonical correlation <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/tGiPX""><span>(Hardoon et al., 2004)</span></a>.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;"">A benefit of the pathway-identification model we employed is that it can, in principle, identify HTH and PAG patterns that distinctly participate in the HTH-PAG pathway. For example, the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) projects to both the hypothalamus and the PAG <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/4yIGk""><span>(Kim et al., 2013)</span></a>, and could indirectly explain variation in BOLD signals in the PAG. To test pathway specificity, we separately modeled a pathway between the CeA and the PAG using the approach described above. This allowed us to evaluate how much variation in PAG activity the HTH-PAG pathway explained above and beyond the CeA-PAG pathway. To evaluate this, we computed the partial correlation between latent sources in the hypothalamus and PAG, controlling for the latent source in the CeA.</p>

Eight-week-old mice were anaesthetized with 1.5-3.0% isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf Instruments). A scalpel was used to open an incision along the midline to expose the skull. After performing a craniotomy, 40 nl of one of the viral vectors listed above at a titer of 2*1012 particles/ml was injected per site (PMd, amv dlPAG) using a 10 ?l nanofil syringe (World Precision Instruments) at 0.08 ?l/min. The syringe was coupled to a 33-gauge beveled needle, and the bevel was placed to face the anterior side of the animal. The syringe was slowly retracted 20 minutes after the start of the infusion. Mice received unilateral viral infusion and fiber optic cannula implantation. Infusion locations measured as anterior-posterior, medial-lateral and dorso-ventral coordinates from bregma were: dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) (-4.75, -0.45, -1.9), dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) (-2.46, -0.5, -5.35) and anteromedial ventral thalamus (amv) (-0.85, -0.5, -3.9). For optogenetic experiments, fiber optic cannula (0.22 NA, 200 ?m diameter; Newdoon) were implanted bilaterally 0.15 mm above the viral infusion sites. Only mice with viral expression restricted to the intended targets were used for behavioral assays.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">For photometry experiments mice were injected with 0.16 uL at a titer of 3*10<sup>12</sup> of AAV9.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 in the PMd of cck-cre mice. The same volume and titer of AAV9.Syn.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 was injected into the dlPAG or amv.† Mice were implanted unilaterally with fiberoptic cannulae in the PMd, amv dlPAG. A 400 ?m diameter, 0.48 NA optical fiber (Neurophotometrics) was used for photometry experiments. Adhesive cement (C&amp;B metabond; Parkell, Edgewood, NY, USA) and dental cement (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) were used to securely attach the fiber optic cannula to the skull. For miniaturized microscope experiments 40 nL of AAV9-DIO-GCaMP6s was injected in the PMd of cck-cre mice and a 7mm GRIN lens was implanted 200 uM above the infusion site. Three weeks following surgery animals were base-plated.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Rat Exposure Assay. </b>Mice were accustomed to handling prior to any behavioral assay. On day 1, mice were habituated to a white rectangular box (70 cm length, 26 cm width, 44 cm height) for 20 minutes. Twenty-four hours later, mice were exposed to the same environment but in the presence of a toy rat for 20 minutes. Mice were then exposed to an adult rat or a toy rat in this environment on the two following days. The rat was secured by a harness tied to one of the walls and could freely ambulate only within a short radius of approximately 20 cm. The mouse was placed near the wall opposite to the rat and freely explored the context for 20 minutes. No separating barrier was placed between the mouse and the rat, allowing for close naturalistic encounters that can induce a variety of robust defensive behaviors.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Contextual Fear Conditioning Test. </b>To better evaluate a broader species-specific defense repertoire in face of a conditioned stimulus, we used a modified version of the standard contextual fear conditioning method <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/PEmIx""><span>(Schuette et al., 2020)</span></a>. Pre-shock, fear conditioning and retrieval sessions were performed in a context (70 cm x 17 cm x 40 cm) with an evenly distributed light intensity of 40 lux and a Coulbourn shock grid (19.5 cm x 17 cm) set at the extreme end of the enclosure. Forty-eight hours after rat exposure, mice were habituated to this context and could freely explore the whole environment for 20 minutes. On the following day, the grid was activated, such that a single 0.7 mA foot shock was delivered for 2 seconds only on the first time the mouse fully entered the grid zone. Twenty-four hours later, retrieval sessions were performed in the same enclosure but without shock. Mice could freely explore the context for 20 minutes during pre-shock habituation, fear conditioning and retrieval sessions.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Behavioral quantification.</b> To extract the pose of freely-behaving mice in the described assays, we implemented DeepLabCut <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/KEP6V""><span>(Nath et al., 2019)</span></a>, an open-source convolutional neural network-based toolbox, to identify mouse nose, ear and tailbase xy-coordinates in each recorded video frame. These coordinates were then used to calculate velocity and position at each timepoint, as well as classify behaviors such as escape runs and freezes in an automated manner using custom Matlab scripts. Specifically:</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">'Escapes' were defined as epochs for which (1) the mouse speed away from the rat or toy rat exceeded 2 cm/s. As there was little room for acceleration between the rat and opposite wall, the speed threshold was set to this relatively low value.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">'Stretch-attend postures' were defined as epochs for which (1) the distance between mouse nose and tailbase exceeded a distance of approximately 1.2 mouse body lengths and (2) mouse tailbase speed fell below 1 cm/s.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">'Freezes' were defined as periods for which mouse nose and tailbase speed fell below 0.25 cm/s for at least 0.33s <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/PEmIx""><span>(Schuette et al., 2020)</span></a>.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">All behaviors were manually checked by the experimenters for error.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Fiber photometry. </b>Photometry was performed as described in detail previously <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/YkWEz""><span>(Kim et al., 2016)</span></a>. Briefly, we used a 405-nm LED and a 470-nm LED (Thorlabs, M405F1 and M470F1) for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>independent isosbestic control measurements. The two LEDs were bandpass filtered (Thorlabs, FB410-10 and FB470-10) and then combined with a 425-nm longpass dichroic mirror (Thorlabs, DMLP425R) and coupled into the microscope using a 495-nm longpass dichroic mirror (Semrock, FF495-Di02-25 ◊36). Mice were connected with a branched patch cord (400 ?m, Doric Lenses, Quebec, Canada) using a zirconia sleeve to the optical system. The signal was captured at 20 Hz (alternating 405-nm LED and 470-nm LED). To correct for signal artifacts of a non biological origin (i.e. photobleaching and movement artifacts), custom Matlab scripts leveraged the reference signal (405-nm), unaffected by calcium saturation, to isolate and remove these effects from the calcium signal (470-nm).</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Fiber Photometry behavior-triggered averaging.</b> To plot the behavior-triggered averages, only mice that displayed a minimum of three behavioral instances were included in the corresponding behavioral figure.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Miniscope postprocessing.</b> The open-source UCLA miniscope analysis package (<a href=""https://github.com/daharoni/Miniscope_Analysis""><span>https://github.com/daharoni/Miniscope_Analysis</span></a>) <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/cHnhz""><span>(Aharoni and Hoogland, 2019)</span></a> was used to motion correct miniscope videos. They were then temporally downsampled by a factor of four and spatially downsampled by a factor of two. The cell activity and footprints were extracted using the open-source package Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for microEndoscopic data (CNMF-E; <a href=""https://github.com/zhoupc/CNMF_E""><span>https://github.com/zhoupc/CNMF_E</span></a>) <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/hwz1e+PEmIx""><span>(Schuette et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2018)</span></a>. Only cells whose variance was greater than or equal to 25<span style=""background:white;"">% of the maximum </span>variance<span style=""background:white;""> among non-outliers were used in the analysis.</span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px;text-align:justify;""><b><span lang=""EN"" style=""background:white;"">Behavior decoding using PMd neural data.</span></b><span lang=""EN"" style=""background:white;""> Discrete classification of escape behavior was performed using multinomial logistic regression. Timepoints following escape by 2 seconds were labelled 'escape,' and a matched number of non-escape timepoints were randomly selected for training and validation. Each time point was treated as an individual data point. Training and validation were performed using 5-fold cross-validation, with a minimum of 10 seconds between training and validation sets. As equal numbers of escape and non-escape samples were used to build the training and validation sets, chance accuracy was 50%. Sessions with less than 5 escapes were excluded from the analysis. The same analysis was performed for approach, stretch-attend postures, and freeze. To predict escape at negative time lags from behavior onset, the same analysis procedure was implemented, using 2-second epochs preceding escape by 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 seconds.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Behavior cell classification.</b> We used a generalized linear model (GLM) to identify cells that showed increased calcium activity during approach, stretch-attend, escape and freeze behaviors. We fit this model to each cell's activity, with behavior indices as the predictor variable and behavior coefficients as the measure of fit. Behavior onset times were then randomized 100 times and a bootstrap distribution built from the resulting GLM coefficients. A cell was considered a behavior-categorized cell if its coefficient exceeded 95% of the bootstrap coefficient values.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Position and speed decoding. </b>To predict position and speed from neural data, these data had their dimensionality reduced by principal component analysis, such that the top principal components, representing at least 80% of the total variance, were used in the following decoding analysis. This output and the related position/speed data were then separated into alternating 60s training and testing blocks, with 10s of separation between blocks. Even blocks were used to train a generalized linear regression model (GLM; Matlab function 'glmfit') and withheld odd blocks were used to test the resulting model.† Accuracies of this withheld testing block were reported as mean squared error.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Chemogenetics. </b>Mice used for chemogenetic experiments were exposed to each threat and control stimuli twice, once following treatment with saline and once following treatment with CNO (5 mg/kg, injected intraperitoneally) 40 minutes prior to the experiment. Only one control or threat-exposure assay was performed per day with each mouse.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Behavior video capture. </b>All behavior videos were captured at 30 frames/sec in standard definition (640x480) using a Logitech HD C310 webcam. To capture fiber-photometry synchronized videos, both the calcium signal and behavior were recorded by the same computer using custom Matlab scripts that also collected timestamp values for each calcium sample/behavioral frame. These timestamps were used to precisely align neural activity and behavior.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Light Delivery for optogenetics.</b> For PMd-cck ChR2 mice, blue light was generated by a 473 nm laser (Dragon Lasers, Changchun Jilin, China) at 4.5 mW unless otherwise indicated. Green light was generated by a 532 nm laser (Dragon Lasers), and bilaterally delivered to mice at 10 mW. A Master-8 pulse generator (A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel) was used to drive the blue laser at 20 Hz. This stimulation pattern was used for all ChR2 experiments. The laser output was delivered to the animal via an optical fiber (200 ?m core, 0.22 numerical aperture, Doric Lenses, Canada) coupled to the fiberoptic implanted on the animals through a zirconia sleeve.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Immunostaining for cfos</b>. Fixed brains were kept in 30% sucrose at 4<sup>o</sup>C overnight, and then sectioned on a cryostat (40 µm) slices. Sections were washed in PBS and incubated in a blocking solution (3% normal donkey serum and 0.3% triton-x in PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were then incubated at 4oC for 12 hours with polyclonal anti-fos antibody made in rabbit (1/500 dilution) (c-Fos (9F6) Rabbit mAb CAT#2250, Cell Signalling Technology) in blocking solution. Following primary antibody incubation sections were washed in PBS 3 times for 10 minutes, and then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody (1/500 dilution) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (red) (CAT# 8889S, cellsignal.com) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were washed in PBS 3 times for 10 minutes, incubated with DAPI (1/50000 dilution in PBS), washed again in PBS and mounted in glass slides using PVA-DABCO (Sigma).</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Perfusion and histological verification.</b> Mice were anesthetized with Fatal-Plus and transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline followed by a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde. Extracted brains were stored for 12 hs at 4∞C in 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were then placed in sucrose for a minimum of 24 hs. Brains were sectioned in the coronal plane in a cryostat, washed in phosphate buffered saline and mounted on glass slides using PVA-DABCO. Images were acquired using a Keyence BZ-X fluorescence microscope with a 10 or 20X air objective.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Acute brain slice preparation and electrophysiological recordings. </b>Cck-cre driver line mice were injected with AAV9-FLEX-ChR2-YFP in the PMd. Acute slices were prepared from these mie. For electrophysiological measurements, slices were transferred as needed to the recording chamber, where they were perfused with oxygenated aCSF at 32∞C. The slices were held in place using a nylon net stretched within a U-shaped platinum wire. Visually-guided whole cell patch clamp recordings were made using infrared differential interference contrast optics. We also verified the identity of PMD neurons by only recording from YFP-positive neurons. All recordings were obtained using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier system (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Experiments were controlled by PClamp 10 software running on a PC, and the data were acquired using the Digidata 1440A acquisition system. All recording electrodes (3-8 M?) were pulled from thin-walled capillary glass (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA) using a Sutter Instruments P97 puller. The patch pipettes were filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 100 K- gluconate, 20 KCl, 4 ATP-Mg, 10 phospho-creatine, 0.3 GTP-Na, and 10 HEPES (in mM) with a pH of 7.3 and osmolarity of 300 mOsm. Only cells with a stable, uncorrected resting membrane potential (RMP) between -50 to -80 mV, overshooting action potentials, and an input resistance (RN) &gt; 100 MW were used. To minimize the influence of voltage-dependent changes on membrane conductances, all cells were studied at a membrane potential near -60 mV (using constant current injection under current clamp mode). To study intrinsic firing properties of PMD neurons, WCRs were conducted under current clamp using the following protocol: (1) Voltageñcurrent (V-I) relations were obtained using 400 ms current steps (range -50 pA to rheobase) and by plotting the plateau voltage deflection against current amplitude. Neuronal input resistance (RN) was determined from the slope of the linear fit of that portion of the V-I plot where the voltage sweeps did not exhibit sags or active conductance. (2) Intrinsic excitability measurements were obtained using 1s current steps (range 0 to 500 pA) and by plotting the number of action potentials fired against current amplitude. (3) Resting membrane potential (RMP) was calculated as the difference between mean membrane potential during the first minute immediately after obtaining whole cell configuration and after withdrawing the electrode from the neuron.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">For validating hM4Di in PMd-cck cells, acute brain slices preparation and electrophysiological recordings were performed using standard methods as previously described <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/7UpM4""><span>(Nagai et al., 2019)</span></a>. Briefly, Cck-Cre+ mice that had received AAV microinjections into PMd were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated with sharp shears. The brains were placed and sliced in ice-cold modified artificial CSF (aCSF) containing the following (in mM): 194 sucrose, 30 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 NaH2PO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 D-glucose, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. A vibratome (DSK-Zero1) was used to cut 300 ?m brain sections. The slices were allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes at 32-34∞C in normal aCSF containing (in mM); 124 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 D-glucose continuously bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices were then stored at 21ñ23∞C in the same buffer until use. All slices were used within 2-6 hours of slicing.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Slices were placed in the recording chamber and continuously perfused with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> bubbled normal aCSF. pCLAMP10.4 software and a Multi-Clamp 700B amplifier was used for electrophysiology (Molecular Devices). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from neurons in the PMd or dorsolateral PAG (dlPAG) using patch pipettes with a typical resistance of 4ñ5 M?. Neurons were selected based on reporter fluorescence,(mCherry for hM4Di-mCherry). The intracellular solution for recordings comprised the following (in mM) : 135 potassium gluconate, 5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP and 0.3 Na-GTP, pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH. The initial access resistance values were &lt; 20 M? for all cells; if this changed by &gt; 20% the cell was discarded. Light flashes (0.2 mW/mm2) from a blue LED light source (Sutter Instruments) were delivered via the microscope optics and a 40x water immersion objective lens and controlled remotely using TTL pulses from Clampex. Cell responses were recorded in whole-cell mode and recorded using an Axopatch 700B amplifier connected via a digitizer to a computer with pCLAMP10 software. To stimulate ChR2 expressed in PMd neurons or axons, 5 ms pulses were delivered at inter-pulse intervals of 200 ms, 50 ms or 25 ms for 5, 20 or 40 Hz optical stimulations, respectively.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) methods</b></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>Participants. </b>This study included 48 adult participants (mean ± SD age: 25.1 ± 7.1; 27 male, 21 female; 7 left-handed; 40 white and 8 non-white (1 Hispanic, 5 Asian, 1 Black and 1 American Indian)). All participants were healthy, with normal or corrected to normal vision and normal hearing, and with no history of psychiatric, physiological or pain disorders and neurological conditions, no current pain symptoms and no MRI contraindications. Eligibility was assessed with a general health questionnaire, a pain safety screening form and an MRI safety screening form. Participants were recruited from the Boulder/Denver Metro Area. The institutional review board of the University of Colorado Boulder approved the study, and all participants provided written informed consent.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>Experimental Paradigm. </b>Participants received five different types of aversive stimulation (mechanical pain, thermal pain, aversive auditory, aversive visual, and pleasant visual), each at four stimulus intensities. 24 stimuli of each type (6 per intensity) were presented over six fMRI runs in random order. Following stimulation on each trial, participants made behavioral ratings of their subjective experience. Participants were instructed to answer the question 'How much do you want to avoid this experience in the future?'. Ratings were made with a non-linear visual analog rating scale, with anchors 'Not at all' and 'Most' displayed at the ends of the scale.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>Stimuli.</b> Visual stimulation<i> </i>was administered on the MRI screen and included normed images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/tVsid""><span>(Lang et al., 2008)</span></a>. To induce four 'stimulus intensity levels' we selected four groups of 7 images based on their†† normed aversiveness ratings (averaged across male and female raters) available in the IAPS database and confirmed by <i>N</i> = 10 lab members (5 male, 5 female) in response to 'How aversive is this image? 1-100'. Selected images included photographs of animals (n=7), bodily illness and injury (n=12), industrial and human waste (n=9). Four stimulus levels were delivered to participants for 10 sec each.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>MRI data acquisition and preprocessing.</b></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;"">Whole-brain fMRI data were acquired on a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma Fit MRI scanner at the Intermountain Neuroimaging Consortium facility at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Structural images were acquired using high-resolution T1 spoiled gradient recall images (SPGR) for anatomical localization and warping to standard MNI space. Functional images were acquired with a multiband EPI sequence (TR = 460 ms, TE = 27.2 ms, field of view = 220 mm, multiband acceleration factor = 8, flip angle = 44∞, 64 ◊ 64 image matrix, 2.7 mm isotropic voxels, 56 interleaved slices, phase encoding posterior &gt;&gt; anterior). Six runs of 7.17 mins duration (934 total measurements) were acquired. Stimulus presentation and behavioral data acquisition were controlled using Psychtoolbox.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;"">FMRI data were preprocessed using an automated pipeline implemented by the Mind Research Network, Albuquerque, NM. Briefly, the preprocessing steps included: distortion correction using FSL's top-up tool (<a href=""https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/topup""><span>https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/</span></a>), motion correction (affine alignment of first EPI volume (reference image) to T1, followed by affine alignment of all EPI volumes to the reference image and estimation of the motion parameter file (sepi_vr_motion.1D, AFNI,<a href=""https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/""> </a><a href=""https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/""><span>https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/</span></a>), spatial normalization via subject's T1 image (T1 normalization to MNI space (nonlinear transform), normalization of EPI image to MNI space (3dNWarpApply, AFNI, <a href=""https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/"">†</a><a href=""https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/""><span>https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/</span></a>), interpolation to 2 mm isotropic voxels and smoothing with a 6 mm FWHM kernel (SPM 8,<a href=""https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/""> </a><a href=""https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/"">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/</a>).</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;"">Prior to first level (within-subject) analysis, we removed the first four volumes to allow for image intensity stabilization. We also identified image-wise outliers by computing both the mean and the standard deviation (across voxels) of intensity values for each image for all slices to remove intermittent gradient and severe motion-related artifacts (spikes) that are present to some degree in all fMRI data.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>fMRI data analysis.</b> Data were analyzed using SPM12 (<a href=""http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm""><span>http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</span></a>) and custom MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) code available from the authors' website (<a href=""http://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore"">http://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore</a>). First-level general linear model (GLM) analyses were conducted in SPM12. The six runs were concatenated for each subject. Boxcar regressors, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function, were constructed to model periods for the 10-second stimulation and 4-7 second rating periods. The fixation cross epoch was used as an implicit baseline. A high-pass filter of 0.008 Hz was applied. Nuisance variables included (a) ""dummy"" regressors coding for each run (intercept for each run); (b) linear drift across time within each run; (c) the six estimated head movement parameters (x, y, z, roll, pitch, and yaw), their mean-centered squares, their derivatives, and squared derivative for each run (total 24 columns); and (d) motion outliers (spikes) identified in the previous step. A ""single-trial model"" was used to uniquely estimate the response to every stimulus in order to assess functional connectivity.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;""><b>Functional connectivity analysis. </b>Functional connectivity between the hypothalamus and PAG was estimated using Partial Least Squares (PLS) <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/YiPzJ""><span>(Wold et al., 2001)</span></a> regression, which identifies latent multivariate patterns that maximize the covariance between two blocks of data (i.e., BOLD activity in hypothalamus and PAG voxels). Here, data comprised single trial estimates of brain activation in response to aversive thermal, mechanical, auditory, and visual stimuli, in addition to a set of pleasant visual stimuli which were used as a control. For the PLS model, the predictor block of variables included all voxels in an anatomically defined mask of the hypothalamus <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/6iTFD""><span>(Pauli et al., 2018)</span></a> (337 voxels) and the outcome block included all voxels in the PAG <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/Ov9VY""><span>(Kragel et al., 2019)</span></a> (42 voxels). Localization of the hypothalamus signal that covaries with the PAG responses was performed by bootstrapping the PLS regression and examining the distribution of PLS regression coefficients and their deviation from zero (using normal approximation for inference). Hyperalignment of fMRI data <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/SXIFJ""><span>(Haxby et al., 2011)</span></a> was conducted separately for each region as a preprocessing step, and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was performed to estimate the strength of functional connections (i.e., the Pearson correlation between the first 'X score' and 'Y score' estimated by PLS, similar to the canonical correlation <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/tGiPX""><span>(Hardoon et al., 2004)</span></a>.</p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;"">A benefit of the pathway-identification model we employed is that it can, in principle, identify HTH and PAG patterns that distinctly participate in the HTH-PAG pathway. For example, the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) projects to both the hypothalamus and the PAG <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/UGfvHz/4yIGk""><span>(Kim et al., 2013)</span></a>, and could indirectly explain variation in BOLD signals in the PAG. To test pathway specificity, we separately modeled a pathway between the CeA and the PAG using the approach described above. This allowed us to evaluate how much variation in PAG activity the HTH-PAG pathway explained above and beyond the CeA-PAG pathway. To evaluate this, we computed the partial correlation between latent sources in the hypothalamus and PAG, controlling for the latent source in the CeA.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><b>Statistics. </b>Nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank or rank-sum tests were used, unless otherwise stated. Two-tailed tests were used throughout with ?=0.05. Asterisks in the Figures indicate the <i>p</i> values. Standard error of the mean was plotted in each Figure as an estimate of variation. Multiple comparisons were adjusted with the false discovery rate (FDR) method.</p> <p>Escape from threats has paramount importance for survival. However, it is unknown if a single circuit controls escape from innate and conditioned threats. The hypothalamic dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) may control escape, as it is strongly activated by escape-inducing threats and projects to the region most implicated in escape, the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG). We show that in mice cholecystokinin (cck)-expressing PMd cells are activated during escape, but not other defensive behaviors. PMd-cck ensemble activity can also predict future escape. Furthermore, PMd inhibition decreases escape speed from both innate and conditioned threats. Inhibition of the PMd-cck projection to the dlPAG also decreased escape speed. Lastly, human fMRI data show that a posterior hypothalamic-to-dlPAG pathway increases activity during exposure to aversive images, indicating that a similar pathway may possibly have a related role in humans. Our data identify the PMd as a central node of the escape network.</p> <p>Explanation of variables used:</p>

Quantifying trait-environment associations can help elucidate the processes underpinning the structure of species assemblages. However, most work has focused on trait variation across rather than within species, meaning that processes operating at the intraspecific levels cannot be detected. Incorporating intraspecific trait variation in community-wide analyses can provide valuable insights about the role of morphological adaptation and plasticity on species persistence and the composition of ecological communities.</p>
<p>2. Here, we assessed geographic variation in the direction (i.e., adaptation) and strength of selection, and the magnitude of plasticity, by examining community-wide trait variation in ant communities along an environmental gradient spanning 9∞ latitude in Quebec, Canada. Specifically, we measured 9 morphological traits related to foraging strategies, resource use and thermal regulation at 20 locations across temperate and boreal forests. We then examined how the mean and variance of these traits varied along temperature and precipitation gradients. Moreover, we examined how these trait-environment relationships varied across levels of organization, from individual workers (intraspecific) to colonies (intraspecific) and species (interspecific).</p>
<p>3. We observed changes in mean trait values along environmental gradients, but very little change in variance. Specifically, we observed a decrease in the mean length of antennae and an increase in the mean eye length from mild (warm and wet) to more extreme environments (cold and dry). These shifts in trait means were mostly coordinated across organizational levels (i.e., worker, colony, and species). We also observed a general increase in trait variance from mild to extreme environments, but only at the species level.</p>
<p>4. Our findings suggest that stressful environmental conditions exert a strong selection pressure on ant morphology causing shifts in optimal trait values. These adaptations may enable persistence at the northern edge of the boreal forest and therefore influence the composition of these ant communities. Specifically, ants with large eyes and short antennae are overrepresented at the transition zone between the boreal forest and the tundra, possibly representing an adaptation to these more open habitats. Our study demonstrates that combining spatial and community-wide intraspecific functional trait data provides a promising way forward to gain new insights on trait adaptations and processes underpinning community structure along environmental gradients.</p>","<p>We measured 9 morphological traits on 37 ant species found in 20 sites along a 9∞ latitudinal gradient in Quebec, Canada.

Grassland plants, especially their root systems, are dynamic and can buffer changes resulting from exposure to multiple stressors; however, the interactive stressor effects on root dynamics and associated aboveground growth are poorly understood.</p>

<p>2. Here, we examine the effects of changed precipitation and air temperature, and defoliation intensity on root length dynamics and aboveground biomass using the third year data from a multifactor experiment conducted across three northern temperate grasslands.</p>

<p>3. We found that root length was more sensitive to the changes in environmental and management conditions than root mass, demonstrating the importance of root length as an indicator of rapid root system changes. Across all sites, warming, altered precipitation, and defoliation intensity interacted to affect root length while aboveground biomass was only affected by defoliation intensity, indicating that the root system was more responsive than aboveground biomass when climatic conditions change. Overall, drought reduced root length, particularly under low defoliation intensity, as well as in combination with warming and heavy defoliation, highlighting the risk of additive effects of such environmental stresses. Across unclipped plots, aboveground biomass was positively associated with total root length, the latter of which further interacted with precipitation, to affect aboveground biomass. Compared to defoliated communities, non-defoliated plant communities exhibited a greater ability to maintain aboveground biomass under drought conditions via increases in root system efficiency (the amount of aboveground biomass produced per unit of root length invested).</p>

<p>4. Our results highlight the rapid change of root length in the face of interactive stressors. We postulate that the degree of stability in aboveground biomass is driven by the altered root system dynamics or species turnover.

For instance, short-distance migrants wintering in temperate regions tend to delay their migration in fall<br>
during spells of warmer temperature. However, some species do not show strong shifts, and the factors determining which species will react to temperature changes by delaying their migration are poorly known. In addition, it is not known whether a slower migration or a postponed departure creates the observed delays in fall migration because most studies occur far south of the boreal breeding areas making it difficult to separate those two mechanisms. We used 22 years of data at a northern observatory in eastern North America, at the southern edge of the boreal forest, to examine how 21 short-distance migrants responded to changing temperatures. We investigated if those species responding to temperature share life history features (i.e. diet, size, total migration distance, breeding habitat, timing of migration). The period of migration in each species was, by far, the most important factor predicting the response of a species to temperature. Eight of the 13 species migrating in October changed their migration onset with temperature (usually by delaying migration by 1-2d/∞C), while the migration timing of none of the eight species migrating in September was dependent on temperature. Furthermore, the absence of a greater migration delay by birds breeding farther from the study site (i.e. Arctic breeding birds) suggests the mechanism is a postponed departure rather than a slower migration. We conclude that temperature variations in late fall influence the conditions on the breeding grounds, so that birds still present at that time might benefit more from postponing their departure in warm weather.</p>","<p>All data was collected between 1996 and 2017 at the Observatoire d'oiseaux de Tadoussac (48.15∫N, 69.66∫W), QuÈbec, Canada.

https://doi.org/10.1093/OXFORDJOURNALS.MOLBEV.A004014,A comparative mitogenomic analysis of the potential adaptive value of Arctic charr mtDNA introgression in brook charr populations (Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill).,"Wild brook charr populations (Salvelinus fontinalis) completely introgressed with the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) of arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) are found in several lakes of northeastern Qu√©bec, Canada. Mitochondrial respiratory enzymes of these populations are thus encoded by their own nuclear DNA and by arctic charr mtDNA. In the present study we performed a comparative sequence analysis of the whole mitochondrial genome of both brook and arctic charr to identify the distribution of mutational differences across these two genomes. This analysis revealed 47 amino acid replacements, 45 of which were confined to subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase complex (Complex I), one in the cox3 gene (Complex IV), and one in the atp8 gene (Complex V). A cladistic approach performed with brook charr, arctic charr, and two other salmonid fishes (rainbow trout [Oncorhynchus mykiss] and Atlantic salmon [Salmo salar]) revealed that only five amino acid replacements were specific to the charr comparison and not shared with the other two salmonids. In addition, five amino acid substitutions localized in the nad2 and nad5 genes denoted negative scores according to the functional properties of amino acids and, therefore, could possibly have an impact on the structure and functional properties of these mitochondrial peptides. The comparison of both brook and arctic charr mtDNA with that of rainbow trout also revealed a relatively constant mutation rate for each specific gene among species, whereas the rate was quite different among genes. This pattern held for both synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide positions. These results, therefore, support the hypothesis of selective constraints acting on synonymous codon usage.",,,"DNA, Mitochondrial; Amino Acids; Salmonidae; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Amino Acid Substitution; Genome, Mitochondrial; CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE; Salvelinus; Surgical Replantation; Salmo salar; Fishes; Genome; NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone)",,1/11/2002,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,"Salvelinus fontinalis, Salvelinus alpinus",,,,,,,,,,,Molecular Biology and Evolution,2002,,(Relevance article : X)
https://doi.org/10.3390/F10040325,A Conceptual Model for Forest Naturalness Assessment and Application in Quebec‚Äôs Boreal Forest,"Research Highlights: To inform eco-designers in green building conception, we propose a conceptual model for the assessment of the impact of using wood on the quality of ecosystems. Background and Objectives: The proposed model allows the assessment of the quality of ecosystems at the landscape level based on the condition of the forest and the proportion of different practices to characterize precisely the forest management strategy. The evaluation provides a numerical index, which corresponds to a suitable format to inform decision-making support tools, such as life cycle analysis. Materials and Methods: Based on the concept of naturalness, the methodology considers five naturalness characteristics (landscape context, forest composition, structure, dead wood, and regeneration process) and relies on forest inventory maps and data. An area within the boreal black spruce-feathermoss ecological domain of Quebec (Canada) was used as a case study for the development of the methodology, designed to be easily exportable. Results: In 2012, the test area had a near-natural class (naturalness index NI = 0.717). Simulation of different management strategies over 70 years shows that, considering 17.9% of strict protected areas, the naturalness index would have lost one to two classes of naturalness (out of five classes), depending on the strategy applied for the regeneration (0.206 ‚â§ ŒîNI ‚â§ 0.413). Without the preservation of the protected areas, the management strategies would have further reduced the naturalness (0.274 ‚â§ ŒîNI ‚â§ 0.492). Apart from exotic species plantation, the most sensitive variables are the percentage of area in irregular, old, and closed forests at time zero and the percentage of area in closed forests, late successional species groups, and modified wetlands after 70 years. Conclusions: Despite the necessity of further model and parameter validation, the use of the index makes it possible to combine the effects of different forestry management strategies and practices into one alteration gradient.",,,Forests; Parameter validation; Map; The Forest; Picea; Wetlands; Decision Making; Population Parameter; Natural regeneration; Ecosystem; Numerical analysis; Gradient; Simulation,,11/4/2019,,2,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,Forests,2019,,

https://doi.org/10.1021/ES0010204,A stable-isotope approach to delineate geographical catchment areas of avian migration monitoring stations in North America.,"Migration monitoring stations (MMSs) were established to provide information on population trends of North American passerines. However, apart from inferring general origins of birds, there has been no way to delineate geographical catchment areas sampled by MMSs. The ability to resolve MMS catchment areas would greatly enhance our ability to link and constrain population declines to specific geographical areas and thereby focus conservation efforts. Here, we utilize stable-hydrogen (delta D) and carbon (delta 13C) isotope values of rectrices of fall hatch-year (HY) and spring adult after-second year (ASY) Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) moving through two MMSs in Canada to determine natal and molting catchment areas for those stations. Stable-carbon isotope signatures provided no information on geographical origins of birds. Conversely, delta D signatures provided good latitudinal geographical control, and this was also supported by analysis of feathers from two other species, Gray-cheeked Thrush (Catharus minimus) and Harris' Sparrow (Zonotrichia querula), also known to breed and molt in northern regions. The delta D values of fall HY birds moving through Delta Marsh MMSs in Manitoba were more negative than those moving through Long Point MMSs in southern Ontario, clearly indicating more northwesterly origins. However, based on delta D values alone, both MMSs sampled birds from broad catchment regions of the Canadian Boreal forest. The interpolated catchment area of the Delta MMS encompassed northwest Manitoba to northwestern Alberta. The interpolated catchment area of the Long Point MMS extended from north central Ontario and Quebec and into western Canada. The delta D values of birds moving northward in spring suggested that most ASY Swainson's Thrush molted at more southerly locations than their breeding sites. We show the stable-hydrogen isotope approach may be employed to significantly improve conventional observational techniques for avian population monitoring, and that MMSs provide a reliable means of associating population productivity with regional conservation issues.",,,Oral candidiasis; Breeding; National origin; Molting; Passeridae; Aves; Methyl Methanesulfonate; hatching; gamma-delta T-Cell Receptor; Isotopes,,1/5/2001,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Maritoba and Ontario

American beech (Fagus grandifolia), a traditionally less desired species, is now increasingly being included in wood supplies to sawmills in western Quebec, where forest managers hope this resource can be valued before the onset of significant mortality and wood degradation from the beech bark disease. This study aimed: 1) to assess the preferences of consumers towards American beech flooring products compared to well known species traditionally used in this market; and 2) to compare results obtained in face-to-face surveys with web-based surveys of consumer preferences. Results from both survey types revealed that the finishing colour was the most important factor affecting the decision of respondents, followed by species and price. American beech ranked third in species preferences, just above birch. Divulgating species names only affected (positively) the perception of respondents towards oak. It was concluded that American beech could be included in the current wood flooring market, probably among cheaper options such as birch. The similarity of results from face-to-face and online surveys suggests that general trends in consumer preferences could be rapidly and cheaply assessed using the latter option.",,,,,27/7/2018,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,other,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Anthidium manicatum (L.) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) found on the island of Newfoundland, Canada.","The island of Newfoundland is North America‚Äôs most easterly landmass, and its depauperate insect fauna is most likely reflective of the island‚Äôs isolation and its harsh climatic conditions. Newfoundland‚Äôs bee fauna is not specious with around 50 species recorded on the island (Hicks 2009), considerably fewer than adjacent mainland areas of Canada (Sheffield et al. 2003; Sheffield et al. 2008). This note details the occurrence of the introduced bee, Anthidium manicatum (L.) in Newfoundland. The native range of Anthidium manicatum is throughout Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but because of unintentional introductions, it has become the world‚Äôs most widespread unmanaged bee species (Strange et al. 2011). The first record of its establishment in North America was in 1963 at Ithaca, New York (Jaycox 1967; Pechuman 1967). While the spread of the bee initially seemed slow, it is now known to occur throughout the eastern and central US (Miller et al. 2002; Tonietto and Ascher 2008), to Colorado and Idaho (Gibbs and Sheffield 2009) and in California (Zavortink and Shanks 2008). The first Canadian record occurred in southern Ontario in 1984 (Smith 1991) where it is now widespread (Romankova 2003). It also now occurs in southern Quebec (Payette 2001), Nova Scotia (Hoebeke and Wheeler 2005), and British Columbia (Gibbs and Sheffield 2009). Anthidium manicatum is easily recognized within the bee fauna of Newfoundland; it has a black body and bold yellow stripes on the metasoma and a rather robust body (Figure 1a). The male has distinctive lateral spines on the 6th abdominal segment and three spines on the terminal segment. Males aggressively defend their territory and use these abdominal spines to knock other bees out of the air, sometimes killing them (Pechuman 1967; Severinghaus et al. 1981). Anthidium manicatum is known as the wool-carder bee because it gathers trichomes from plants that have dense pubescence on their leaves (Figure 1b). The ‚Äúwool‚Äù collected is used to line its brood cells which are constructed in a variety of pre-existing cavities in wood and other substrates. The brood cells are provisioned with a mixture of pollen and nectar (M√ºller et al. 1996). An egg is laid on the provision and the bee larva feeds and develops from this provision. M√ºller et al. (1996) describe how these bees also collect glandular products from plant trichomes on the basitarsis of the front legs and include these products among the wool. They surmise that the addition of the plant secretions to the wool helps waterproof the brood cells and also prevents microbial growth. The carding of wool by this species of bee seems to be restricted to plants in the Lamiaceae (mint family) where the non-native Lamb‚Äôs Ears, Stachys byzantina K. Kock, is the common host. Nectar foraging by Anthidium manicatum occurs on many different plant species, within the Lamiaceae, Fabaceae and Scrophulariaceae (Payette 2001; Zavortink and Shanks 2008). However, other plants (e.g., Asteraceae) may be utilized to a lesser extent (Miller et al. 2002). Anthidium manicatum was collected for the first time by the author on the west coast of Newfoundland on 21 July 2011 in Corner Brook (48.951528oN: 57.93465oW); a female resting on the side of a house. An additional female was captured by the author on 3 August taking nectar from Trifolium pratense L. (Fabaceae) near the first site. On 6 August, two areas of Stachys byzantina were located in the vicinity and several male and female Anthidium manicatum Anthidium manicatum (L.)

These results are relevant to the ongoing public discussion in Qu√©bec about designating new parks and refuges so that the province may fulfil its obligations to Canada's Endangered Spaces Campaign. The prioritization algorithm used in this analysis is based on rarity and complementarity. It attempts to sample biodiversity in as area-efficient a way as possible. The biodiversity surrogates used here comprise a subset of 743 species for which data on spatial distributions are publicly available; the analysis begins with 394 species at risk. It is shown that: (i) the existing network of protected areas in Qu√©bec does a poor job of protecting these biodiversity surrogates; (ii) adding adjacent areas to this network will not be the optimal way of protecting these biodiversity surrogates; (iii) many of the areas that have highest priority are in southern Qu√©bec, which has a high human population density; (iv) because of (iii), designating parks may not be economically or sociologically feasible and more adaptive alternative conservation plans will have to be devised; (v) coastal areas, riparian habitats, and other wetlands should have high priority for protection but are currently very inadequately represented in the reserve network; (vi) there is some reason for concern about the clear-cut logging of boreal forests in northern Qu√©bec; and (vii) the islands, √éle d'Anticosti and the √éles-de-la-Madeleine, emerge as being of very significant conservation value and plans for the protection of areas on them should be an immediate goal for biodiversity conservation in Qu√©bec.",,,Forests; Population Density; Park (environment); Vii; Complementarity theory; Mangrove Swamps; Subgroup; Wetlands; Algorithm; Habitat; Linear algebra; Surrogates; Emoticon; Spaces,,1/9/2001,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,article,article,no,NA,no,743 species (flora and fauna),1974-1999,source publication text,25,no,1500000,source publication text,,,,H,Biodiversity and Conservation,,,Only a list of species names

,"Arrenodes minutus (Drury, 1770) (Coleoptera: Brentidae) discovered in the Maritime Provinces of Canada.","Brentidae are large, elongate weevils found under the bark of various dead and dying deciduous trees. Females excavate a hole with their rostrum into which they deposit their eggs. Larvae bore deep into the heartwood where they appear to feed on wood and fungal mycelia (Anderson and Kissinger 2002). In North America the family is represented by five species in five genera. Three of these are found in southern Florida, and one in southern Texas. Arrenodes minutus (Drury, 1770) ranges throughout the eastern United States, north to southern Ontario and Qu√©bec (McNamara 1991; Laplante et al. 1991; Anderson and Kissinger 2002). Colloquially known as the ‚Äúoak timberworm,‚Äù larvae of A. minutus are frequently found boring in oaks (Quercus spp.) and other hardwoods. Adults feed at sap flows on oaks. Males are territorial and aggressive with one another and guard females during egg laying (Buchanan 1960; Sanborne 1983). When Majka et al. (2007) surveyed the introduced Apionidae (pear-shaped weevils) and Brentidae (straight-snouted weevils) of the Maritime Provinces, they reported a specimen of Arrenodes minutus intercepted in Nova Scotia in wooden furniture imported from Indiana in the United States. Recently, specimens of A. minutus have been found in both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia (Figs. 1-2) that establish the presence of this species, and hence the family Brentidae, in the Maritime Provinces.

,ArticleExploration for platinum-group minerals in till: A new approach to the recovery,"The discovery of new mineral deposits contributes to the sustainable mineral industrial development, which is essential to satisfy global resource demands. The exploration for new mineral resources is challenging in Canada since its vast lands are mostly covered by a thick layer of Quaternary sediments that obscure bedrock geology. In the course of the recent decades, indicator minerals recovered from till heavy mineral concentrates have been effectively used to prospect for a broad range of mineral deposits including diamond, gold, and base metals. However, these methods traditionally focus on (visual) investigation of the 0.25‚Äì2.0 mm grain-size fraction of unconsolidated sediments, whilst our observations emphasize on higher abundance, or sometimes unique occurrence of precious metal (Au, Ag, and platinum-group elements) minerals in the finer-grained fractions (<0.25 mm). This study aims to present the advantages of applying a mineral detection routine initially developed for gold grains counting and characterization, to platinum-group minerals in < 50 Œºm till heavy mineral concentrates. This technique, which uses an automated scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer, can provide quantitative mineralogical and semi-quantitative chemical data of heavy minerals of interest, simultaneously. This work presents the mineralogical and chemical characteristics, the grain size distribution, and the surface textures of 2664 discrete platinum-group mineral grains recovered from the processing of 5194 glacial sediment samples collected from different zones in the Canadian Shield (mostly Quebec and Ontario provinces). Fifty-eight different platinum-group mineral species have been identified to date, among which sperrylite (PtAs2) is by far the most abundant (n = 1488; 55.86%). Textural and mineral-chemical data suggest that detrital platinum-group minerals in the studied samples have been derived, at least in part, from Au-rich ore systems.",,,,,2021,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,no biological,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Assessing the Effectiveness of Instream Structures for Restoring Salmonid Streams,"Stream restoration is a billion dollar industry in North America. Despite this expenditure there remain questions regarding the effectiveness of current techniques, such as instream structures. The objectives of this research were to assess the impact of instream structures on physical habitat in the Nicolet River (Quebec) and to analyze physical habitat and fish abundance data from a large number of restoration projects using meta-analysis. Results of intensive surveys of the Nicolet River suggest that the installation of weirs and deflectors resulted in a greater frequency of pools. These pools have significantly greater depths, lower velocities and larger sediment size than those without structures. Compilation of data from 211 stream restoration projects showed a significant increase in pool area, average depth, large woody debris and percent cover as well as a decrease in riffle area following the installation of instream structures. The physical changes observed in the Nicolet River resulted in improved trout habitat, as measured by applying habitat preference curves, but uneven stocking practices and fishing pressure confounded attempts to verify differences in trout density among pool types. The meta-analysis, however, showed a significant increase in salmonid density and biomass following the installation of structures, although the relationship with physical habitat variables is not strong. Large differences in density response were observed between species. This compilation highlights the potential of instream structures to create better habitat for and increase the abundance of salmonids, but the scarcity of long-term monitoring of the effectiveness of instream structures is problematic.",,,Salmonidae; Large; Compiler; Habitat; Circuit restoration,,2009,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No relevant data
https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11232745,Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Black Spruce Bud Phenology across Quebec Based on MODIS-NDVI Time Series and Field Observations,"Satellite remote sensing is a widely accessible tool to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in the bud phenology of evergreen species, which show limited seasonal changes in canopy greenness. However, there is a need for precise and compatible data to compare remote sensing time series with field observations. In this study, fortnightly MODIS-NDVI was fitted using double-logistic functions and calibrated using ordinal logit models with the sequential phases of bud phenology collected during 2015, 2017 and 2018 in a black spruce stand. Bud break and bud set were spatialized for the period 2009‚Äì2018 across 5000 stands in Quebec, Canada. The first phase of bud break and the last phase of bud set were observed in the field in mid-May and at the beginning of September, when NDVI was 80.5% and 92.2% of its maximum amplitude, respectively. The NDVI rate of change was estimated at 0.07 in spring and 0.04 in autumn.

Multiple regression analyses were used to assess the respective effects of stand structure, species composition, site characteristics, and the forest composition surrounding the stand on observed stand mortality. Mortality was observed to increase in relation to diameter of the trees, basal area of balsam fir, and the number of stands dominated by conifers in the forest mosaic. All of these factors showed significant independent effects, but 60% of the variance remained unexplained. Site characteristics, however, did not show a significant relationship to stand mortality.

However, it remains controversial whether these reductions in diversity will affect energy flow and nutrient cycling. Diversity has two components: species richness, or the number of plant species in a given area, and species evenness, or how well distributed abundance or biomass is among species within a community. We experimentally varied species evenness and the identity of the dominant plant species in an old field of Quebec to test whether plant productivity would increase with increasing levels of evenness, and whether relationships would be invariant with respect to species identity. Total and belowground biomass increased linearly with increasing levels of evenness after one growing season. These relationships did not depend on the identity of the dominant species. Relationships between aboveground biomass and evenness varied and depended on the identity of...",,,Sampling (signal processing); Community; Gene Ontology Term Enrichment; Nutrient cycle; Fragmentation (computing); Ecosystem; Experiment; Space: Above and Beyond,,1/4/2000,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,site coordinates,>1,km,,,,,,,,,,Ecology,2000,,(Relevance article : L)
https://doi.org/10.1656/045.027.0416,Biophysical Features Determining Avian Use of Roadside Verges in Southern Qu√©bec's Suburban and Rural Landscapes,"Abstract - Habitat loss and degradation due to urbanization and intensification of agriculture are among the leading causes of the decline of biodiversity on Earth. Vegetated zones of rights-of-ways (the median zone and roadside verges) could, however, contribute to wildlife conservation where remaining natural habitats continue to rapidly disappear. The objective of this study is to identify biophysical features of the various maintenance units (green shoulders, embankments, ditches, and banks) of highway roadside verges (HRVs) in suburban and rural landscapes that influence avian abundance and richness. Results indicate that wider HRVs favor a greater use by birds, particularly when in association with an increase in the shrub cover in ditches and embankments. Since maximizing the contribution of the vegetated zones of the road network is now an important consideration in regional biodiversity conservation strategies in human-dominated landscapes, we recommend that embankments and banks should have a diversified plant structure and cover. Various changes to the conventional methods of the maintenance of vegetation along HRVs are therefore proposed, such as halting mowing for a period of 5 to 10 years to favor the succession of native plant species. Maximizing the contribution of HRV to bird conservation in suburban and rural landscapes will also have other environmental and social benefits.",,,,,8/12/2020,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,NA,CANT ACCESS,,,,,,,,,,,,BioOne,2000,,

These cities have a similar urban structure that permits investigation along an urbanization gradient from downtown to rural residential areas. However, they are in opposite temperate climate and imbedded in a forested and an agricultural landscape, respectively. Plots ranging from 10 to 20 ha were surveyed in winter and spring by recording all birds seen or heard. Most plots could be located along a gradient according to proportions of vegetated open space. Both the Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indices of diversity indicated a pattern of increasing diversity from most to least urbanized areas in spring. Winter species diversity and richness was low in Quebec compared to Rennes, reflecting the much harsher winter conditions in Quebec. Breeding densities of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) and European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were quite similar in Quebec and Rennes, as were densities of European Blackbirds (Turdus merula) and its ecological equivalent in Quebec, the American Robin (Turdus migratorius). The type of surrounding landscape can not explain the variation of species numbers within the city. If we examine the urban environment as a new ecological system rather than a degraded environment, we can regroup birds in two major species groups: the omnivorous species adapted to the urban environment and its particular food resources such as garbage and the species that find, in the urban environment, resources which they normally exploit in their usual habitat.",,,Simpson's rule; density; Cooperative breeding; Sturnidae; Passeridae; Shannon (unit); Urban ecosystem; Aves; License; Gradient; Urbanization,,1/8/1998,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,administration unit,c.40 bird species,,,,,,,,,,,Ornithological Applications,1998,,(Relevance article : L)

One of the last intact forest landscapes south of the 50th parallel in Qu√©bec includes the Ya'nienhonhndeh territory, which has been the focus of a protected area project directed by the Huron-Wendat First Nation for more than ten years. To contribute to the characterization of its conservation value, we report the calicioids from the area. We identified 34 species in eight genera from 187 samples collected in old-growth stands of balsam fir, black spruce and yellow birch. Our four most remarkable discoveries are Chaenotheca nitidula Tibell (n = 11), Chaenothecopsis australis Tibell (n = 1), and C. tsugae Rikkinen (n = 2), which are reported for the first time from the province, as well as Sclerophora coniophaea (Norman) Mattsson & Middelb.

Insights from seedlings under various canopies in southern Quebec,"Understanding tree recruitment dynamics in various growth environments is essential for a better assessment of tree species‚Äô adaptive capacity to climate change. We investigated the microsite factors influencing survival, growth, and foliar nutrition of natural and planted sugar maple seedlings (Acer saccharum) along a gradient of tree species that reflect the change in composition from temperate hardwoods to boreal forests of eastern Canada. We specifically tested whether the increasing abundance of conifers in the forest and its modifications on soil properties negatively affects foliar nutrition of natural seedlings as well as the survival and growth of seedlings planted directly in the natural soil and in pots filled with enriched soil. Results of natural seedlings indicate that under conifer-dominated stands, lower soil pH, accelerated dissolution of some minerals, lower temperature and moisture, and higher levels of phenolic compounds have created microsites that are less suitable for sugar maple foliar nutrition and regeneration. These conditions were omnipresent under hemlock. The growth of seedlings planted in the natural soil was negatively impacted by the overall low soil quality under all forest types (as compared to seedlings planted in pots with enriched soil). However, survival and growth of the seedlings were not negatively affected by conifers, regardless of planting type, likely because of stored nutrients from the nursery. Also, lower survival was found under maple‚Äìbirch stands for seedlings planted both in the natural soil and in pots with enriched soil due to higher shading. This study has identified key microsite factors created by specific conifers that may impede or benefit the potential of sugar maple to maintain its current range or expand its range northward under climate change.",,,Climate Change; Forests; Maple; phenolics; Phenol formaldehyde resin; The Forest; Hemlock (editor); Coniferophyta; Impacted tooth; Minerals; Shading; Betula Genus; Seedlings; Gradient; Fill; Tsuga,,2018,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,site coordinates,11 tree species,,,,,,,,,,,Ecosphere,2018,,(Relevance article : L)
,"CAREX √óCAYOUETTEI (CYPERACEAE), A NEW INTERSECTIONAL SEDGE HYBRID FROM SOUTHERN QUEÃÅBEC, CANADA","A putative hybrid of Carex (Cyperaceae) was discovered in a swamp in the Montr√©al regi on (southern Qu√©bec, Canada). A survey of the surrounding vegetati on, numerical phenetic analysis, and use of proxies of plant sterility showed that the individuals w ere sterile intersectional hybrids between sects. Lupulinae and Vesicariae. We propose the name Carex √ócayouettei A. Bergeron, hybr. nov. for the hybrid combination C. comosa √ó C. lupulina. Several factors (reproduction time, habitat and natural range) support the assumption that the hybrid is likely more common than suggested by previous knowledge, but difficulties encountered in identification may have limited documentation. This finding strengthens the evidence that Lupulinae and Vesicariae are closely related. An unidentified sedge was discovered near a swamp during a su rvey of an urban forest in the metropolitan Montr√©al area. The plant did not resemble a ny known species of the region; we thus suspected that it was a natural hybrid. Initially, Carex lupulina and C. pseudocyperus seemed to be possible parents (authorities are given in Appendix 1), since both were found in the swamp near the unfamiliar sedge. Such a combination was nevertheless questi onable because intersectional hybrids between sects. Lupulinae Tuck. ex J. Carey and Vesicariae (Heuff.) J. Carey [combined with sect. Pseudocypereae (Tuck.) Christ sensu Ball & Reznicek 2002] are uncommon (Cayouette & Catling 1992). In addition, visual analysis of the characters was problematic, particularly in relation to size of vegetative organs, which did not appear intermediate. Although hybrid vigor exists among sedges, the intermediate state or presence of some characters mo re related to one of the parents is essential to the determination of legitimate intersectional hybrids such as C. lupulina √ó retrorsa Schwein. (Dudley 1886; Cayouette & Catling 1992). We therefore examined t h sedge vegetation around the unfamiliar plant more closely, and performed a phenetic an alysis involving several other putative parents to determine which ones were involved in the hybrid com bination. Study site The unidentified sedge was found at the Bois-de-Saraguay Na ture-Park (45¬∞ 30.9' N, 73¬∞ 44.5' W), southern Qu√©bec, Canada. This Park is one of t h best preserved urban forests on the Island of Montr√©al, not only because of restricted public access, but also because of its size (96 ha). This mature forest is characterized by a mosaic of mesic a nd hygric habitats with tree associations dominated by Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, and Tilia americana on well-drained soils, swamps dominated by Acer saccharinum, and Fraxinus pennsylvanica on poorly-drained soils (Domon et al. 1986). In an exhaustive floristic survey (152 pers on-days) carried out by our research team between June and August 2011, a total of ca. 389 taxa w ere recorded, which represents a high level of richness for the region. Sedges accounted for a pool of 32 species (Appendix 1). Several rare Qu√©bec plants are only present in this park (Bergeron & Pell erin 2011; Bergeron et al. 2013). Despite low levels of past anthropogenic disturbances in this urban cont ext, ca. 21% of florula is composed of naturalized and ephemeral plants. Bergeron and Pellerin: Carex √ócayouettei, intersectional hybrid 2 Fieldwork and laboratory During the plant survey of an open, flooded swamp on July 7, 2011, w e collected the putative sedge hybrid for the first time. On July 14, 2011, we returned to the site to note all sedge species present in the swamp and within radii of 10 and 5 meters of the put ative hybrid population. Macromorphological characters were measured in situ and ex situ on live specimens and those collected; the latter were then dried. Nine to twelve ra ndom measurements were taken for each character. In the laboratory, pollen grains were stai ned with cotton blue (lactophenol) to indicate defective cytoplasm. In order to collect the achenes, we examined the site closely a final time on October 16, 2011. Phenetic analysis After a summary examination of macromorphological measurements , we classified the putative hybrid as belonging to the group of ‚Äúbladder‚Äù and ‚Äúbottlebr ush‚Äù sedges (sensu Hipp 2008). The specimens bore long and inflated perigynia, which disti nguish the sect. Lupulinae and pistillate scales with scabrous awns characterizing, ter alia, the sect. Vesicariae. Furthermore, the broad vegetative blades on the putative hybrid could place it not far f rom the broadly construed sect. Paludosae (Heuff.) Christ (Ball & Reznicek 2002). For phenetic analysis, we first checked the sedge list for the Bois-de-Saraguay (Appendix 1) to select the putative parents among Carex sects. Lupulinae, Vesicariae, and Paludosae. We included species belonging to the three sections, with the exception of C. grayi (globular spikes) and C. pellita (pubescent perigynia), which have characters too distant f rom the putative hybrid. Second, we included five species forming hybrid combinations according to Cayouette and Catling (1992) and with documented occurrences in the Montr√©al region and souther n Qu√©bec (A. Bergeron, unpub. data; Brouillet et al., 2010+). Carex lupuliformis Sartwell ex Dewey was not selected due to its rarity nd remote populations well-researched in the context of the Pe ll rin‚Äôs team‚Äôs project, ‚ÄúRescuing false hop sedge‚Äù (Environment Canada 2014). Finally, we included thre e species exhibiting some ornamental qualities, unlisted for Qu√©bec but possibly pres ent due to escape from cultivation. In order of selection as described above, the 13 species are the following: C. intumescens, C. lacustris, C. lupulina, C. pseudocyperus, C. retrorsa, C. comosa Boott, C. hystericina Muhl. ex Willd., C. lurida Wahlenb., C. utriculata Boott, C. vesicaria L., C. acutiformis Ehrh., C. gigantea Rudge, and C. hyalinolepis Steud. Measurements of macromorphological characters related to the 13 possible parents were compiled from the literature (Gleason & Cronquist 1991; Hill 2006; Ball & Reznicek 2002; Jones 2010). Data analysis was performed by Principal Coordin ates Analysis (PCoA) with Caillez correction (Legendre & Legendre 2012, p. 493) on the mid-point of m in and max values of each character. The PCoAs were calculated on character tabl es rescaled in Gower‚Äôs dissimilarity matrix (Legendre & Legendre 2012, p. 278), and then multiplied with an F-ratio weighting (Adams 1972, 1982). With the min and max values of each character, an F-r tio (intergroup variance √∑ intragroup variance) was calculated from an ANOVA between the spec ies. Derived from the literature, these ranges of values establish the true boundaries of the specie , which guarantees the validity of the calculations even if the intragroup variance were computed on only two degrees of freedom. In fact, we also tried the PCoAs without weighting (Adams 1972, 1982), which did not alter our conclusions. However, the weighting with the F-ratios gave the greatest amount of explained variance on the first two PCoA axes, which justified the use of this procedure. Note also that these numerical methods are not statistical hypothesis tests. We used the weighted PC oAs to synthesize information and draw a conclusion based on decisions. All analyses were performed using the R language (R core team, 2013). Bergeron and Pellerin: Carex √ócayouettei, intersectional hybrid 3 Preliminary analysis Eighteen selected characters known to discriminate sedges within and between the three sections were used (Table 1) in a preliminary analysis whi ch aimed to reduce the number of putative parents to be examined in detail. By excluding the putative hy brid, we calculated F-ratios for weighting each of the 18 characters (Table 1). Ordination of the first two PCoA axes with the 14 taxa including the putative hybrid (80% of explained variance) made it possible to segregate sedge sections and identify species with characters too dista nt from the putative hybrid. All members of sect. Paludosae were discarded. We then calculated two other PCoAs that le d to the successive removal of species distantly related to the putative hybrid . The last preliminary PCoA was performed on seven taxa (94% of explained variance) and placed the putati ve hybrid approximately in the middle of the PCoA axis I, the Lupulinae being on one side and Pseudocypereae [incl. within sect. Vesicariae] on the other. Triplet analysis To show the intermediate state of the putative hybrid relati v to the characters of two sedge species, we only retained the six most likely parents ( Carex comosa, C. gigantea, C. hystericina, C. intumescens, C. lupulina, and C. pseudocyperus) found in preliminary analyses. For the final analyses, we included 23 characters to improve refinement o f the differences between taxa, and calculated new F-ratios (by excluding the putative hybrid) for weighting each of these characters (Table 1). By considering one species of sect. Lupulinae, the putative hybrid, and one species of sect. Pseudocypereae, we performed nine weighted PCoAs i.e., on all possib le combinations of triplets. Table 1. Description of characters and units used in th e phenetic analysis.

The fauna of Newfoundland is about equivalent in species richness to that of Quebec and almost twice as rich as the recorded fauna of the Maritime Provinces. Few species are common to the three areas.

Endogeic species were extracted from soil cores using Berlese-Tullgren funnels while epigeic species were collected using pit-light traps (Luminoc¬Æ). Comparisons of species presence, abundance, and dominance among sites and seasons were done using Sorensen's similarity coefficients and CANOCO. A total of 92 species from 7 families and 35 genera were identified. Species dominance and community structure differed according to humus types. Two groups of endogeic species were identified. The mor/mor-moder type group included Folsomia penicula, Hypogastrura (Ceratophysella) spp. Que., Micrisotoma achromata, Onychiurus (Protaphorura)? parvicornis, Onychiurus (Onychiurus) sp. A Que.

The mull/mull-moder type group included Isotoma (Desoria) notabilis, Tullbergia (Tullbergia) silvicola, Tullbergia (Tullbergia) clavata , and Pseudosinella alba. Such clear humus type relationships were not found among the epigeic species, but important seasonal changes in community structures were found for these species. Spring species were Sminthurinus (Katiannina) macgillivrayi, Hypogastrura (Ceratophysella) maheuxi, Hypogastrura (Hypogastrura) sp. A Que. and Sminthurinus (Sminthurinus) latimaculosus. Tomocerus (Pogonognathellus) flavescens, Sminthurinus (Sminthurinus) henshawi , and Orchesella hexfasciata appeared in the summer samples while Dicyrtoma (Dicyrtoma) aurata was found only in fall samples where it was dominant in most sites along with either Sminthurides (Sminthurides) lepus or Sminthurinus (Sminthurinus) quadrimaculatus.

https://doi.org/10.1086/671900,Comparative Physiology and Relative Swimming Performance of Three Redhorse (Moxostoma spp.) Species: Associations with Fishway Passage Success*,"Our understanding of biological criteria to inform fish passage design is limited, partially due to the lack of understanding of biological motivators, cues, and constraints, as well as a lack of biological performance evaluations of structures once they are built. The Vianney-Legendre vertical slot fishway on the Richelieu River, Quebec, Canada, passes large numbers of migrating redhorse (Moxostoma spp.) upriver to spawning grounds each year. We evaluated the physiological capacity and relative swimming ability of three redhorse species (Moxostoma anisurum, Moxostoma carinatum, Moxostoma macrolepidotum; silver, river, and shorthead redhorse, respectively) to determine how these biotic factors relate to variation in fishway passage success and duration. Shorthead redhorse had higher maximum metabolic rates and were faster swimmers than silver and river redhorse at their species-specific peak migration temperatures. Blood lactate and glucose concentrations recovered more quickly for river redhorse than for silver and shorthead redhorse, and river redhorse placed second in terms of metabolic recovery and swim speed. Interestingly, fish sampled from the top of the fishway had nearly identical lactate, glucose, and pH values compared to control fish. Using passive integrated transponders in 2010 and 2012, we observed that passage success and duration were highly variable among redhorse species and were not consistent among years, suggesting that other factors such as water temperature and river flows may modulate passage success.

We also assessed the effect of environmental conditions on potential differences between the results obtained using these two sampling methods. Sampling sites were distributed in the Laurentian region of Qu√©bec. Both methods were used while sections were blocked. Three snorkelers swam the river sections upstream while identifying and counting fish of each species and size classes. Three-pass electrofishing was performed in the same sites and abundances were estimated with a maximum likelihood depletion model. Greater abundances of fish were observed by snorkeling than by electrofishing at all sites. Snorkeling species richness was higher or equal to electrofishing richness in, respectively, 60¬†% and 40¬†% of sampled sites. Differences in the fish communities observed by both sampling methods were not related to environmental conditions. The results of our work are therefore contrary to that of most published studies that suggested the use of electrofishing over visual surveys.

Detection of microcystin biosynthetic genes in water blooms of cyanobacteria is generally indicative of the presence of potentially toxic cyanobacterial strains. Although much effort has been devoted toward elucidating the microcystin biosynthesis mechanisms in many cyanobacteria genera, little is known about the impacts of co‚Äêoccurring cyanobacteria on cellular growth, mcy gene expression, or mcy gene copy distribution. The present study utilized conventional microscopy, qPCR assays, and enzyme‚Äêlinked immunosorbent assay to study how competition between microcystin‚Äêproducing Microcystis aeruginosa CPCC 299 and Planktothrix agardhii NIVA‚ÄêCYA 126 impacts mcyE gene expression, mcyE gene copies, and microcystin concentration under controlled laboratory conditions. Furthermore, analyses of environmental water samples from the Missisquoi Bay, Quebec, enabled us to determine how the various potential toxigenic cyanobacterial biomass proxies correlated with cellular microcystin concentrations in a freshwater lake. Results from our laboratory study indicated significant downregulation of mcyE gene expression in mixed cultures of M. aeruginosa plus P. agardhii on most sampling days in agreement with depressed growth recorded in the mixed cultures, suggesting that interaction between the two species probably resulted in suppressed growth and mcyE gene expression in the mixed cultures. Furthermore, although mcyE gene copies and McyE transcripts were detected in all laboratory and field samples with measureable microcystin levels, only mcyE gene copies showed significant positive correlations (R2 > 0.7) with microcystin concentrations, while McyE transcript levels did not. These results suggest that mcyE gene copies are better indicators of potential risks from microcystins than McyE transcript levels or conventional biomass proxies, especially in water bodies comprising mixed assemblages of toxic and nontoxic cyanobacteria.",,,negative regulation of threonine-tRNA ligase activity; Anabolism; Mental association; Microcystin; Proxy; Scientific Publication; Human body; Cyanobacteria; Transcript; Depressive disorder; Biomass; Cyclosporine; cell growth; Hypericum perforatum; Gene Expression; Culture Media; positive regulation of leucine-tRNA ligase activity; Copy (object); organelle membrane contact site,,17/5/2014,,8,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,cyanobacterias,,,,,,,,,,,Microbiology Open,2013,,(Relevance article : X)
,CONSIDERATIONS FOR INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT OF MOOSE IN ALASKA,"The Alaska Legislature recently passed a law directing the Alaska Board of Game to identify certain game populations that will be managed intensively. This mandate implies management for maximum sustained yield (MSY), yet managing populations for MSY is problematic. Overharvest at MS Y may cause populations to decrease to low levels, and in the presence of predation lowdensity equilibria can be established. We recommend maintaining intensively managed populations at densities above the actual point of MSY to avoid potential over-harvests caused by stochastic variation in recruitment. Managing intensively will require better information on factors that influence recruitment and corresponding rates of increase in moose populations, including: age at first reproduction; rates of pregnancy, twinning, age-specific survival, dispersal, and predation; as well as population sex ratios. Population modeling indicates that rate of increase is most sensitive to changes in adult survival, but under most circumstances in real moose populations, calf survival is very important. Factors affecting calf survival include habitat quality, weather, and predation, and the effects of these factors can be minimized by maintaining moose densities slightly above those which maximize recruitment. An intensive management strategy for moose populations in Alaska must include the ability to implement cow harvests, predator management, and habitat management. Aggressive monitoring of population parameters, cause-specific mortality rates, trends in habitat quality, and a knowledge of carrying capacity will be essential to selecting appropriate management strategies. Gaining this information will be expensive but the alternative is potential mismanagement and the risk of population declines. The State of Alaska recently enacted legislation instituting a policy of intensive management of selected ungulate populations. The Alaska Board of Game is charged with identifying populations of moose (Alces alces) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) for which human consumptive use is the primary management objective. These populations are to be managed intensively to produce and maintain high levels of human harvest. A proposed amendment to this legislation defined harvestable surplus as the number of animals born less the number dying, excluding harvest and predation. At least 50% of this harvestable surplus was to be allocated to human harvest. This amendment was passed by the legislature in 1996 15 ALCES VOL. 32 (1996) pp.l5-24 but was vetoed by the governor. Although not stated specifically in the enabling legislation, this intensive management policy implies management for maximum sustained yield (MSY). In this paper, we review briefly the concept of MSY and the reasons why this is not a viable management objective, and we recommend an alternative for optimizing yields. We also review the factors affecting recruitment in moose populations and discuss strategies for managing these factors. While it is impossible to address comprehensive moose management strategies without considering the effect of habitat, we have purposely avoided detailed discussion of habitat evaluation and management. Knowledge of habitat stability (static MANAGING FOR MSYHUNDERTMARK AND SCHWARTZ ALCES VOL. 32 (1996) or seral communities), plant species composition, site characteristics, and the effects of manipulations on non-target wildlife, among other factors is critical to proper habitat management, but these topics have been reviewed elsewhere (e.g., Eastman and Ritcey 1987, Joyal 1987, Oldemeyer and Regelin 1987). Here we only identify the density-dependent relationships between habitat productivity and population parameters. MSY AND POPULATION REGULATION ., Maximum sustained yield occurs when a population is managed at the point of maximum recruitment. Using a logistic growth equation, this point occurs at a population density one-half (K/2) that at nutritional carrying capacity (K). Population growth below this point is density-independent and recruitment increases with population size solely because of the increased number of breeders. Mortality from hunting and predation are largely additive at these low densities. Above MSY, density-dependent processes regulate population growth by reducing fecundity and juvenile survival. Mortality from hunting and predation are increasingly compensatory as densities increase. Management of ungulate populations at MSY is not a new concept, as any densitydependent model of population growth can be used to estimate the density at which MSY is obtained (Caughley 1976). Modeling exercises of ungulate populations indicate that MSY occurs at densities greater than K/2, ranging from 56-72% of K (Caughley 1976, McCullough 1979, Crete eta/. 1981), but we recommend caution in using these estimates. Crete et al. ( 1981) provided the only estimate of MSY for moose (64-72% of K) but they used a definition of K that is less than nutritional carrying capacity. Their estimate of MSY would decrease if expressed as a percentage of nutritional K. In the real world, however, management of ungulate 16 populations at MSY is rarely achieved. The public ultimately decides the density at which ungulate populations will be managed and this often equates to the maximum number of adults that the habitat can support (McCullough 1979). Management at MSY is fraught with risk (Larkin 1977, Holt and Talbot 1978, MacNab 1985). Although once a mainstay of fisheries management, MSY was found to be too difficult to achieve over the long term and often led to declining stocks (Larkin 1977). Setting a harvest level to maintain a population at MSY can result in over-harvest given stochastic variation in recruitment and nonharvest mortality. A model of moose population dynamics indicated that overharvests at MSY can result in drastic population declines (Van Ballenberghe and Dart 1982). Such an overharvest results in a smaller base population which produces fewer recruits the following year. An identical harvest accelerates the decline and continues the positive feedback loop. Current survey and inventory procedures are not likely to detect overharvests or decreasing densities unless they are extreme, at which point drastic management actions will be required to correct the problem. Crete et al. (1981) observed dramatically increased hunter effort at low moose densities in Quebec and suggested that this would serve to reduce harvests at low densities and consequently break the feedback loop. Their data indicate, however, that effort is a sensitive indicator of density only below a density of 0.2 moose/ km2, which is approximately equal to the density at which predation limits moose populations in Alaska and Yukon (Gasaway et al. 1992). Thus, this index would be unsuitable for moose management in Alaska. Predation confounds the management of ungulate populations in many cases, as dynamics of moose and their predators can vary considerably among populations (Van Ballenberghe and Ballard 1994 ). Three forms ALCES VOL. 32 (1996) HUNDERTMARK AND SCHWARTZMANAGING FOR MSY of a general model of wolf (Canis lupus)moose dynamics were proposed by Messier (1994) in which the degree of limitation of moose population growth by wolf predation varies. In general, wolf predation rate increases sharply with moose density at low densities (below approximately 0.65 moose/ km2) and becomes inversely density-dependent at moderate to high moose densities. The relative strengths of predation and habitat productivity determine whether predation will limit moose populations at some equilibrium level below K (Messier 1995). Bear ( U rsus spp.) predation differs from wolf predation in that it is largely independent of moose density (Ballard and Larsen 1987, Schwartz and Franzmann 1991). The combined effect of bear and wolf predation therefore can increase the potential for lowdensity equilibria compared with wolf/moose systems (Gasaway et al. 1992, Messier 1995). In systems with little human intervention and containing both bears and wolves, moose populations limited at low densities are to be expected (VanBallenberghe and Ballard 1994). These same density relationships, however, can be exploited in certain cases where reduction of predation is desired. As neither form of predation is regulatory at moderate moose densities, reduction of one predator will not trigger an increase in predation rate by the other (Dale et al. 1994), which can simplify predator management strategies. Gasaway et al. ( 1992) demonstrated that predation is capable of limiting moose populations at low densities, and Messier and Crete (1985) provided evidence suggesting wolf predation may perhaps regulate moose densities. Therefore, managers attempting to generate harvests from moose populations must strive to maintain high moose densities and low predator: moose ratios. Yet as moose density approaches K, the adverse effects on population stability of density-independent factors such as severe winter weather in17 crease (Skogland 1985), which can cause catastrophic population declines and re-establishment of low-density equilibria. MANAGING POPULATION GROWTH FOR OPTIMUM YIELD When maximum yields from moose populations are desired, we recommend a conservative approach that maintains population size somewhat higher than at MSY and optimizes, rather than maximizes, yield. McCullough ( 1979) defined such a population level as the fixed removal yield and defined it as ""the maximum fixed number of animals that can be removed from a population with fluctuating recruitment withoutdriving the population to extinction"" (McCullough 1979:129). A management objective specifying a range of acceptable population densities is superior to an objective of one fixed density and we concur with Gasaway et al. (1992) that a range of optimum density with MSY as the lower limit of the range is desirable (Fig. 1).

(Yuncker 1932, 1965) and extends northward to Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana and Idaho (USDA NRCS2004). The species also occurs mMexico, Central and South America (Yuncker 1932, 1965). Weare reporting here the first record of this species for southern Saskatchewan, Canada. Its presence mthe Canadian Provinces adjacent to its northern range was to be expected, and further f loristic research may reveal its occurrence in southern Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario. Although C indecora has definite weedy tendencies (Parker & Riches 1993), taking into account the natural habitats it was found in, the species may be considered native to southern Canada as well. The species was cultivated experimentally in Ontario and Alberta (vouchers at DAOand ALTA, respectively), but it has never spread (see also Crins & Ford 1988). The host range of C. indecora is wide, in^ eluding numerous herbaceous and woody plants (Yuncker 1965). Cuscuta indecora and C coryli Engelm from subsection Indecorae Yuncker are probably sister species (Costea et al. unpublished). Cuscuta coryli in Canada, is rare in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec (Argus & Pryer 1990). Both species have in common the fleshy, papillate flowers with corolla lobes acute and inflexed. Cuscuta indecora differs from C. coryli mainly through the 5-merous flowers, 2‚Äî5mmlong, having usually large and abundantly fringed intrastaminal scales. Cuscuta coryli has flowers commonly 4^merous, ca. 2 mm long, and infrastaminal scales are reduced to winged or toothed ridges.

This beetle has killed millions of ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees in several states in the United States and in Canada. This beetle is difficult to detect when it invades new areas or occurs at low density, and for the foreseeable future, girdled trap tree and ground surveys will be important tools for detecting emerald ash borer populations. A field experiment was established at Straits State Park, St. Ignace, Michigan in 2008 to characterize the effectiveness of different trap types in an area of known low density population of emerald ash borer. This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of girdled and non-girdled trap trees and the baited prism traps to detect adults and larvae of the emerald ash borer. Canopy assessments of trees were carried out to determine if the canopy condition was predictive of whether a tree was infested with emerald ash borer or not. Adult beetles were not detected using the baited purple prism trap during the trapping survey, and only one adult beetle was caught on a girdled trap tree during the flight season. Eight of the girdled trap trees contained larvae when peeled, and only one tree containing a purple prism trap contained larvae. No non-girdled trap trees were infested. Canopy condition of these trees was not predictive of infestation. Of the girdled trees, infested trees were larger in diameter than non-infested trees. The use of 17 large girdled trap trees may be the most effective tool for detecting emerald ash borer at low density, whereas baited purple prism traps may be ineffective when the population density of the insect is very low. Introduction The exotic emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) (EAB), was first discovered in North America in southeastern Michigan, USA, and Windsor, Ontario, Canada in 2002 (Cappaert et al. 2005, Siegert et al. 2007). This insect pest of North American ash (Fraxinus spp.) is thought to have been introduced into Michigan from Asia in the 1990s based on recent dendrochronological evidence (Cappaert et al. 2005). It has been estimated that approximately 50 million trees have been infested with EAB in Michigan, northern Ohio, and northern Indiana (Smith et al. unpublished). Infestations are also known to occur in Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, USA, and Quebec, Canada (EAB Info 2008). This boring beetle is thought to have arrived from Asia as a stowaway in solid wood packing material (Poland & McCullough 2006), and continues to spread both naturally and from human-assisted movement of ash nursery stock, logs, and firewood, initiating outlier infestations (Poland 2007). In North America, ash species in the genus Fraxinus are the only suitable host of EAB, and are threatened by the continued spread of this pest (Anulewicz et al. 2008). Adult EAB flight starts in May and goes through August with the timing in this window varying according to location.

To this end, many environmental indicators have been developed worldwide and there is a growing need to evaluate their performance by calculating ecological status in a wide range of ecosystems at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This study calculated and contrasted sixteen indicators of ecological status from three methodological categories: abundance measures, diversity parameters and characteristic species. This selection was applied to coastal benthic ecosystems at Sept-√éles (Qu√©bec, Canada), an important industrial harbor area in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and related to habitat parameters (organic matter, grain size fractions, and heavy metal concentrations). Nearly all indicators highlighted a generally good ecological status in the study area, where communities presented an unperturbed profile with high taxa and functional diversities and without the dominance of opportunistic taxa.

A lack of seed trees, difficulties in the establishment of natural regeneration and high browsing pressure caused by increasing deer populations have been identified as plausible causes. Current silvicultural strategies for cedar restoration recommend partial cutting to promote and release natural regeneration, but there is also a need to restore the species in areas where it became absent.

Although microcystins are extensively studied, other cyanopeptides produced by common bloom‚Äêforming species have received little attention. Cyanopeptolins are a large cyanopeptide group that contain a characteristic 3‚Äêamino‚Äê6‚Äêhydroxy‚Äê2‚Äêpiperidone (Ahp) moiety. In the present study we used diagnostic fragmentation filtering (DFF), a semitargeted liquid chromatography‚Äêtandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) product ion filtering approach, to investigate cyanopeptolin diversity from 5 Microcystis strains and 4 bloom samples collected from lakes in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. Data processing by DFF was used to search MS/MS data sets for pairs of diagnostic product ions corresponding to cyanopeptolin partial sequences. For example, diagnostic product ions at m/z 150.0912 and 215.1183 identified cyanopeptolins with the NMe‚ÄêTyr‚ÄìPhe‚ÄìAhp partial sequence. Forty‚Äêeight different cyanopeptolins, including 35 new variants, were detected from studied strains and bloom samples. Different cyanopeptolin profiles were identified from each sample. We detected a new compound, cyanopeptolin 1143, from a bloom and elucidated its planar structure from subsequent targeted MS/MS experiments. Diagnostic fragmentation filtering is a rapid, easy‚Äêto‚Äêperform postacquisition metabolomics strategy for inferring structural features and prioritizing new compounds for further study and dereplication.

,Distribution Patterns of Birds Associated with Snags in Natural and Managed Eastern Boreal Forests 1,"In boreal forests, several bird species use standing dead trees for feeding or nesting and depend on them for their survival. Studies on wildlife use of snags have shown that their availability is greatly influenced by the age of the forest and the type of perturbation (natural versus anthropogenic). Accordingly, cavity-nesting birds seem largely affected by these changes in availability of snags. In North American boreal forests, relationships between birds and dead wood availability have predominantly been documented in western forests. The dynamics of dead wood and the distribution patterns of birds associated with this habitat feature remain largely unknown in eastern black spruce forests. Distribution patterns of birds associated with dead wood were documented in the eastern black spruce forest of northwestern Quebec, Canada. Study areas were composed of four forest landscapes (50-100 km 2 ) that were naturally disturbed by different fire events (1 year, 20 years, 100 years and > 200 years) and two logged landscapes (20 years, 80 years). Birds were surveyed by point counts. Overall, 348 point counts were distributed over the six forest landscapes. Vegetation plots centered at each point count were used to sample live trees and dead wood. In naturally disturbed forest landscapes, species richness and abundance cavity-nesting birds reached a peak in early post-fire and in mature forest landscapes. Standing dead wood availability and abundance patterns of cavity-nesting birds were significantly less in 20-year-old managed forests landscapes than in those of naturally disturbed forests landscapes. This pattern was persistent in mature forests comparisons between 80-year-old horse-logged second-growth forests and mature forests of post-fire origin. Our results suggest that old-growth forests in this portion of the eastern black-spruce forest ecosystem do not play a key role for cavitynesting birds. Mature and over-mature stands are, however, key habitats for many species of secondary cavity nesters, whereas early post-fire stands are key habitats for primary cavitynesting birds and represent the main source of recruitment for standing dead wood in this ecosystem. Changes in silvicultural practices designed to maintain specific structure of overmature stands (increased partial cutting) may provide a means for maintaining cavity-nesting birds at the landscape scale. Intensification of salvage cutting in early post-fire landscapes is another serious concern in black spruce forests. Reduction in the overall availability of dead wood through such forest practice may affect populations of some primary cavity nesters that are restricted to this specific forest type.",,,Baillie‚ÄìPSW primality test; Ecosystem; Population; Data recovery; Forests; Picea; Rainforest; Trees (plant); Habitat; Recommender system; Aves; Email; Jacques Gauthier; Ecology; The Forest; Conferences; United States Department of Agriculture; Body cavities; Gradient; Persistent data structure,,2002,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,"Map, range coordinates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(Relevance article: X) no data
https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12536,Divergence between riparian seed banks and standing vegetation increases along successional trajectories,"Questions 
Plant community resilience largely depends on the secondary succession induced by species re-colonization from seed banks. Soil seed bank resilience is, however, poorly understood, especially in regularly disturbed habitats like riparian zones. Two questions were asked: what are the changes in species diversity experienced by riparian soil seed banks along successional trajectories, and to what extent do riparian soil seed banks promote vegetation resilience during secondary succession? 
 
Location 
Southeastern Quebec, Canada. 
 
Methods 
Soils were collected along five rivers in field edges and riverbanks of post-agricultural riparian zones with three contrasting successional stages (unplanted ‚Äì planted with trees 15-17¬†years prior to sampling ‚Äì natural riparian forests), and their seed bank composition determined with the seedling emergence method. Species richness in seed banks was assessed along successional trajectories for distinct ecological groups, using linear mixed models. The compositions of soil seed banks and standing vegetation (from botanical surveys) were compared based on NMDS and Indicator Species Analysis. 
 
Results 
Seed bank species richness decreased along successional trajectories. Tree-planted riparian zones were generally closer to unplanted riparian zones than to natural riparian forests, the latter being more species-rich for natives, trees, shrubs and zoochores, and species-poor for exotics, forbs and stress-tolerators. Likewise, seed bank species composition of unplanted and tree-planted riparian zones was similar but differed from those of natural riparian forests. Conversely, standing vegetation of tree-planted riparian zones was intermediate between early- and late-successional stages, at least at field edges. For the three successional stages, seed bank composition clearly differed from standing vegetation. 
 
Conclusions 
The high resilience of riparian plant communities appeared poorly related to the dynamics of their soil seed banks. This species shift between seed banks and standing vegetation during secondary succession is likely due to periodic flooding leading to the regular turnover of seeds. The resilience of riparian communities might thus be more influenced by spatial dispersal along rivers and across landscapes than by in situ temporal dispersal in soils.

https://doi.org/10.1111/ECOG.00836,Does probability of occurrence relate to population dynamics?,"Hutchinson defined species' realized niche as the set of environmental conditions in which populations can persist in the presence of competitors. In terms of demography, the realized niche corresponds to the environments where the intrinsic growth rate (r) of populations is positive. Observed species occurrences should reflect the realized niche when additional processes like dispersal and local extinction lags do not have overwhelming effects. Despite the foundational nature of these ideas, quantitative assessments of the relationship between range-wide demographic performance and occurrence probability have not been made. This assessment is needed both to improve our conceptual understanding of species' niches and ranges and to develop reliable mechanistic models of species geographic distributions that incorporate demography and species interactions. The objective of this study is to analyse how demographic parameters (intrinsic growth rate r and carrying capacity K) and population density (N) relate to occurrence probability (Pocc ). We hypothesized that these relationships vary with species' competitive ability. Demographic parameters, density, and occurrence probability were estimated for 108 tree species from four temperate forest inventory surveys (Qu√©bec, Western US, France and Switzerland). We used published information of shade tolerance as indicators of light competition strategy, assuming that high tolerance denotes high competitive capacity in stable forest environments. Interestingly, relationships between demographic parameters and occurrence probability did not vary substantially across degrees of shade tolerance and regions. Although they were influenced by the uncertainty in the estimation of the demographic parameters, we found that r was generally negatively correlated with Pocc , while N, and for most regions K, was generally positively correlated with Pocc . Thus, in temperate forest trees the regions of highest occurrence probability are those with high densities but slow intrinsic population growth rates. The uncertain relationships between demography and occurrence probability suggests caution when linking species distribution and demographic models.",,,Trees (plant); Demography; Immune Tolerance,,1/12/2014,,2,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ecography,2014,,"(Relevance article: X) No data.

A test with a shallow fluvial lake system,"Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) plays important roles in shallow lakes. In addition to its refuge effect for zooplankton, one key role of SAV is to provide diverse ecological niches to these organisms. The reduction of habitat complexity due to loss of SAV might thus have huge effects on zooplankton communities. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between SAV abundance and composition and zooplankton functional diversity and community structure. We used as model system the littoral zone of Lake St. Pierre (Qu√©bec, Canada), a shallow fluvial lake experiencing dramatic changes in SAV cover. Our sampling protocol allowed us to analyse the relationship between SAV and zooplankton along a gradient of SAV abundance. We showed that SAV abundance explained 41% of the variation in the zooplankton community structure and 25% of the variation in zooplankton functional diversity. Our results also indicated that the presence of the benthic cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia sp. in SAV beds had a structuring effect within the dominant family of Chydoridae, being negatively correlated to the abundance of relatively large-bodied species. Our findings suggest that loss in SAV biomass and complexity can affect both community structure and functional diversity of zooplankton in shallow fluvial lakes.",,,Sampling (signal processing); Community; Complexity; CNS disorder; Beds; SP/k; Zooplankton; Aquatic ecosystem; Challenge‚Äìresponse spam filtering; Gradient,,15/2/2016,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,no,NA,"Map, geospatial feature",Zooplankton families (c.15) and genera (c.15),no,NA,no,NA,80,no,abundance,,,,Hydrobiologia,,,
,"Dytiscidae and Noteridae of Wisconsin (Coleoptera). V. Distribution, Habitat, Life Cycle, and Identification of Species of Hydroporinae, Except Hydroporus Clairville Sensu Lato","Thirty species in 11 genera of Hydroporinae were collected in Wisconsin over the past 32 years, excluding those in Hyd rporus s.l. Fourteen species of Hygrotus were found; other genera were represented by one to four species. Species keys and notes on identification are provided for adults of all species that occur or may occur in Wisconsin. Information on distribution and abun¬≠ dance in Wisconsin, habitat, a d life cycle is provided for each species based on a study of 34,628 adults. Life cycles were predominantly univoltine, with adults overwintering and larvae completing development from late spring to late summer, depending on the species.

Adults of 66 species in 16 genera of Hydroporinae were collected in Wis¬≠ consin. Eleven genera and 30 species are treated here as the result of a study of 34,628 adults from Wisconsm (Table 1); larvae are too poorly known to be useful in this study. The remaining five genera, Heterosternuta, Hydroporus, Hydroporus oblitus-group, Neoporus, and Santilippodytes, which are often treated as subgenera of Hydroporus, will be discussed in part VI. Information on Bidess otus and two species of Hygrotus that possibly could occur in Wisconsin, is also included. Listed separately in Table 1 are records of beetles from McKenna Pond (Hilsenhoff 1992) and ponds at the Leopold Memorial Reserve in Sauk County (Hilsenhoff 1993).

Adults of most species apparently overwinter in aquatic habitats; however, adults of Laccornis and Hygrotus compar probably overwinter in or adjacent to shallow terre trial sites that may become flooded in the spring. Bidessonotus Regimbart, 1895 Larson and Roughley (1991) reported B. inconspicuus (LeConte, 1955) from Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia, and B. pulicarius (Aube, 1838) from Ontario, but no member of this southern genus was collected in Wisconsin. Although B. inconspicuus was included in the generic key (Hilsenhoff 1992), I believe it is unlikely a y species of Bid s notus occurs in Wisconsin because winter temperatures are probably too cold. Young (1954) provided a key to adults of the three most northern species. Celina Aube 1836 Young (1979) published a key to species in North America and described four new species, inCluding the only one occurring in the north-central United States. Other species have a southern or coastal distribution. 2 The Great Lakes Entomologist, Vol. 26, No. 4 [1994], Art. 3 https://scholar.valpo.edu/tgle/vol26/iss4/3 1994 THE GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST 277 Celina bubbelli Young, 1979 Distribution and Abundance: Uncommon in southern third, very rare far¬≠ ther north (Table 1). County records: 25, 48;54-55, 57-61, 63-65, 68. Range: ON-PQ-MD-AL-KS. Habitat: Most beetles were collected from shallow len tic habitats with cattails (Typha); Young (1979) commented on their association with cattails. In late September, two students in my class collected several C. hubbelli adults from an aggregation of ""about a hundred"" they found on roots of a cattail. I believe the spinose ends of the abdomen and elytra may be used to pierce cattails and obtain oxygen for respiration in a manner similar to that used by Coquillettidia and Mansonia mosquito larvae. Spangler (1973) sug¬≠ gested the recurved extensions of the lateral tracheal trunks of larvae were also used for that purpose. This would permit both adults and larvae to remain on cattails without having to surface for air. Life Cycle: Adults occurred 13 May to 29 September, most of them in June; teneral adults were found 24 and 29 September. Adults probably over¬≠ winter on roots of cattails and do not become active until mid-May, when the soil in which cattails grow finally: warms. This leads to delayed mating and oviposition, with larvae not completing development until late summer. It is unlikely the teneral adults resulted from a second generation. Identification: The spinose apicies of the abdomen and elytra in Celina are distinctive; the size and brown color, with the basal fourth of t e elytra and pronotum paler, separate C. hubbelli from C. angustata, the most similar species. A larva of Celina from Maryland that was described by Spangler (1973) as C. angustata may have been C. hubbelli, which also occurs in Mary¬≠ land and was not described until 1979. Desmopacbria Babington, 1841 One species of this neotropical genus occurs in the northern United States and Canada. Young (1981) studied the convexa¬∑grana group and provided a key to species of adults. Desmopacbria convexa (Aube, 1838) Distribution and Abundance: Very common statewide (Table 1). County records: 1-27, 29-33, 35-61, 63-72. Range: NT-PE-GA-TX-WY. Habitat: Most adults were collected from ponds, especially smaller ponds in open areas; they also were found in marshes, bogs, swamps, and ditches. Life Cycle: Adults occurred 22 February to 14 November, with substan¬≠ tial numbers being collected in October. Teneral adults (88) were found 16 June to 30 September, all except three from 28 June to 3 September; most later collections were from northern counties. In the laboratory, Barman (1973) reared eggs to adults in about 25 days. Adults apparently overwinter in ponds, then mat and oviposit in late Mayor June; most larvae complete development in July and August. The life cycle is probably univoltine. but a partial second generation may occur in some years. Identification: The very small size, almost round shape. and rather uni¬≠ formly brown color make adults easy to recognize. In Wisconsin they most resemble adults ofHygrotus farctus, which are about the same size and nearly the same shape and color; however. adults of that species have much longer antennae and longer legs with basally narrowed and slightly arcuate tibiae.

,Eastern-breeding Lesser Yellowlegs are more likely than western-breeding birds to visit areas with high shorebird hunting during southward migration,"Shorebirds have experienced a precipitous reduction in abundance over the past four decades. While some threats to shorebirds are widespread (e.g., habitat alteration), others are regional and may affect specific populations. Lesser Yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes) are long-distance migrants that breed across the North American boreal biome and have declined in abundance by 60‚Äì80% since the 1970s. The documented harvest of Lesser Yellowlegs in the Caribbean and northeastern South America during southward migration is a possible limiting factor for the species, but it is unknown to what extent birds from different breeding origins may be affected. To address the question of differential occurrence in harvest zones during southward migration, we used PinPoint GPS Argos transmitters to track the southward migrations of 85 adult Lesser Yellowlegs from across the species‚Äô breeding range and 80¬∞ of longitude from Anchorage, Alaska, USA, to the Mingan Archipelago, Quebec, Canada. We classified migratory locations as inside or outside three zones with high levels of harvest (Caribbean, coastal Guianas, and coastal Brazil) and then fit generalized additive mixed models to estimate the probability of occurrence of Lesser Yellowlegs in harvest zones according to their breeding origin. Individuals from the Eastern Canada population had a higher probability of occurrence within one or more harvest zones and remained in those zones longer than individuals breeding in Alaska and western Canada. Linear regressions also suggested that longitude of the breeding origin is an important predictor of occurrence in harvest zones during southward migration. Lastly, our findings, combined with other sources of evidence, suggest that current estimated harvest rates may exceed sustainable limits for Lesser Yellowlegs, which warrants further investigation.",,,,,2021,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,Lesser Yellowlegs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(Relevance article: X) No data.

However, other ecological factors may also be important, especially when the northern limit of the dominant species of a vegetation zone extends further than the limit of the zone itself. This study aimed to identify the ecological variables explaining the transition between two zones within the boreal biome in Quebec (eastern Canada): the southern mixedwood forests dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and white birch (Betula papyrifera), and the northern coniferous forests dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana).



Location‚ÄÇ Quebec (eastern Canada).



Methods‚ÄÇ Data from 5023 sampling plots from the ecological inventory of the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources distributed throughout the two bioclimatic zones were used in logistic regressions to determine the relationships between the presence or absence of balsam fir stands and different abiotic and biotic variables, at both stand and landscape scales.



Results‚ÄÇ The presence of balsam fir stands was negatively related to the thick organic horizons, coarse xeric deposits and low positions on the slope, whereas stands were favoured by high elevations, steep slopes and moderate drainage. These results defined the suitable conditions for the development of balsam fir stands. In the coniferous zone these suitable conditions were less abundant. Furthermore, the saturation level of suitable sites was lower, as well as the incidence of balsam fir stands in unsuitable sites (overflow). Balsam fir stands were mostly located near lakes and rivers. All significant variables at both the stand and landscape scales explained between 34 and 42% of the location of the potential northern distribution limit of the mixedwood zone.

 Canadian peatlands are subject to disturbance and destruction, and drainage for agriculture is responsible for 85% of this degradation. Few studies have explicitly addressed the effects of habitat degradation on arthropod diversity in Nearctic peatlands. Because higher Diptera (Brachycera) in peatlands are diverse, are an important component of food webs, and exhibit a wide range of ecological requirements, we examined species richness, abundance, and community composition of Brachycera across transects at 1, 6, and 11 m from a collector drainage ditch in Johnville Bog and Forest Park, Quebec. In total, 1453 Brachycera were collected, representing 24 families and 166 species. Species diversity (based on Simpson's diversity index) and rarefaction-estimated species richness were higher at 6 and 11 m than at 1 m from the ditch, probably because of the homogeneous moss cover and moister conditions at greater distance from the ditch. Species composition also differed between 1 m and other distances, based on cluster analysis, multiresponse permutation procedures analysis, and the presence of five predaceous species that were significant indicator species 1 m from the drainage ditch. Our results suggest that anthropogenic degradation of hydrological conditions may be responsible for the low species richness and high dominance of a few species currently seen at the ditch margin.",,,,,1/4/2010,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,site coordinates,166 species of insects of order Brachycera (Dyptera),,,,,,,presence only,,,,The Canadian Entomologist,2012,,"(Relevance article: M) In the appendix, the species names are provided"

We evaluated the relative effects of urban and agricultural landscapes on anuran species richness and the abundance of six anuran species found at breeding ponds in and around the cities of Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec. We performed six call surveys at 29 permanent focal ponds surrounded by one of three landscape contexts: primarily urban, primarily agricultural, and primarily forested. We also measured three local pond variables to control for the effects of local habitat quality in our analyses. We found that anuran species richness was significantly lower in breeding ponds in urban landscapes compared to forested and agricultural landscapes, which exhibited no significant difference in species richness. The abundances of individual anuran species were also consistently lower in urban landscapes for all species except one, which exhibited no response to landscape type. Three species had their highest abundances in ponds in forested landscapes, whereas two species had their highest abundances in ponds in agricultural landscapes. We conclude that ponds embedded in urban landscapes support lower biodiversity than ponds in agricultural settings.

,Effects from environmental Mn exposures: a review of the evidence from non-occupational exposure studies.,"OBJECTIVE
The risk posed to human health by environmental manganese exposure is unknown. Occupational-exposure outcomes may not extrapolate to environmental exposures due to the healthy worker effect and differences in dosage parameters which may affect the biological response. This paper attempts to combine the existing literature on non-occupational Mn exposures with results from our current study in SW Quebec on environmental Mn exposure (Mergler et al., this issue) within the framework of a biologically-based, dose-response (BBDR) model. BBDR MODEL: The basic BBDR model consists of seven stages relating exposure to health effects. The stages are: 1) sources, 2) applied dose, 3) absorbed dose, 4) target-site dose, 5) toxic event, 6) measurable change, and 7) health outcome.


RESULTS
Several air monitoring programs, such as the PTEAM study (Riverside, CA, 1990, mean PM10 Mn outdoor-airborne 24 h average = 0.045 microgram/m3), provided data relevant to the estimation of Mn applied dose, but did not include measures of body burden. Data from the SW Quebec study showed a mean total-particulate airborne Mn concentration of 0.022 microgram/m3 with a range of 0.009 to 0.035 microgram/m3 across four sampling sites, whereas the EPA reference concentration (RfC) is 0.05 microgram/m3. EPA has considered tap water levels to be safe below 200 micrograms/l Mn, and mean Mn tap-water (MnW) level in the participants' homes was 6.38 +/- 11.95 micrograms/l with a range from 0.1 to 158.9 micrograms/l Mn. A previous study of MnW exposure in Greece reported Mn levels in areas with low, medium and high MnW ranging from 4 to 2,300 micrograms/l and a significant association with Mn in hair but not Mn in blood (MnB). The mean absorbed dose of the SW Quebec study participants, as indicated by MnB, was 7.5 +/- 2.3 micrograms/l with a range of 2.5 to 15.9 micrograms/l. Our study and others on environmental Mn exposure did not provide an estimate of target-site dose. However, a significant correlation (r = 0.65) between MnB and signal intensity in T1-weighted MRI images has been reported in liver-disease patients with Parkinson-like signs who had MnB levels as low as 6.6 micrograms/l. Only animal and in vitro studies have provided evidence on the mechanisms of toxicity caused by Mn in the CNS. Several studies reported measurable changes in endpoints suggestive of a Parkinson-like syndrome in subjects with MnB levels ranging from 7.5 to 25.0 micrograms/l. Among other effects on neurobehavioral function observed in the current study was a significant relationship between MnB and the direction and speed of body-sway in men. The effects observed in these participants are sub-clinical and no health outcomes have been diagnosed. However, the Parkinson's disease incidence in the study area was previously reported to be 2-5 times higher than in the rest of Quebec, and several studies indicate that 25-35% of idiopathic Parkinson disease diagnoses are incorrect. Our study, the Greek study, and some clinical studies suggest that the risk of a Parkinson-like syndrome diagnosis may increase with continued Mn exposure and aging.


CONCLUSION
The limited data available for the BBDR model point to the need for evidence, particularly on relationships between Mn species, exposure route, MnB with chronic environmental exposure, ageing, and susceptibility factors, to improve human-health risk assessments for chronic, environmental Mn exposure.",,,Risk Assessment; In Vitro [Publication Type]; Parkinsonian Disorders; Adverse reaction to drug; Occupational Diseases; Eicosapentaenoic Acid; Body Burden; Particulate (substance); Environmental Exposure; Aging; Parkinson Disease; Liver diseases,,1/4/1999,,7,semantic_scholar,,,,other,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not related to biodiversity (effect of Mn on human health)

We hypothesized that habitat modifications through logging and forest fire alter the space-use pattern of woodland caribou and result ultimately in lowered density. To test this hypothesis, density, distribution, space-use patterns, and mortality of caribou in disturbed landscapes (DLs) and undisturbed landscapes (ULs) of central Qu√©bec were quantified by a systematic aerial survey (42 539 km2) and telemetry of 68 adult caribou females. A ground survey of terrestrial and arboreal lichens was carried out to estimate production of lichens in DLs and ULs. Three populations that occupied between 10 000 and 15 000 km2 were identified in the study area. Caribou abundance was not limited by intraspecific competition for food. Production of terrestrial lichens was estimated to support 3 to 4 times the surveyed caribou density (1.2‚Äì2.1‚Äì100 km‚àí2). Pregnancy rate was almost 100%, indicating that females were not food-limited. Space-use patterns were affected by forest disturbance. In DLs, caribou increased home range sizes and reduced fidelity to seasonal and annual home ranges, probably to avoid disturbed habitats. In response, the probability of surviving decreased with the extent of DL within home ranges. To help keep direct and indirect sources of caribou mortality at very low levels, forest management strategies should be oriented toward the protection of large interconnected blocks of forest to favour caribou spacing away from humans and predators and to maintain adequate space-use strategies.",,,,,1/12/2007,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bio One,2007,,
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0109261,"Effects of Habitat-Forming Species Richness, Evenness, Identity, and Abundance on Benthic Intertidal Community Establishment and Productivity","In a context of reduced global biodiversity, the potential impacts from the loss of habitat-forming species (HFS) on ecosystem structure and functioning must be established. These species are often the main community primary producers and have a major role in the establishment of organisms through facilitation processes. This study focuses on macroalgae and mussels as HFS within an intertidal zone along the St. Lawrence estuary (Quebec, Canada). Over a 16-week period, we manipulated the in situ diversity profile (richness, evenness, identity, and abundance) of the dominant HFS (Fucus distichus edentatus, F. vesiculosus, and Mytilus spp.) in order to define their role in both the establishment of associated species and community primary production. Contrary to expectation, no general change in HFS richness, evenness, abundance, or identity on associated species community establishment was observed. However, over the study period, the HFS diversity profile modified the structure within the trophic guilds, which may potentially affect further community functions. Also, our results showed that the low abundance of HFS had a negative impact on the primary productivity of the community. Our results suggest that HFS diversity profiles have a limited short-term role in our study habitat and may indicate that biological forcing in these intertidal communities is less important than environmental conditions.

,Effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors on biomarkers of fish health in spottail shiners (Notropis hudsonius),"Parasites and pollution are natural and anthropogenic stressors respectively in fishes. A range of biomarkers have been used to assess the sublethal effects of pollutants in fish, but few studies have examined sublethal effects of parasites and pollution in combination. I examined seven biomarkers (pigmented macrophage centres and pigmented macrophage counts in the spleen, pigmented macrophage counts in the liver, white blood cell counts, haematocrit, leucocrit, and condition factor) and parasite abundances in 204 (age 1+ and 2+) spottail shiners ( Notropis hudsonius ) collected at three polluted and two reference localities in the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada. The number of pigmented macrophage centres and pigmented macrophages in the spleen was significantly higher at polluted localities than at reference localities. Seven of the nine species of parasites found in 1+ fish showed significant correlations with biomarkers. More parasites (18 species) but few significant correlations were observed in 2+ fish, indicating that parasite effects are more pronounced in young spottail shiners. A significant negative relationship was observed between condition factor and Neoechinorhynchus rutili (Acanthocephala) in 1+ fish, indicating its potential pathological significance in fish. High abundance of Plagioporus sinitsini (Digenea) was associated with increased spleen macrophage counts and decreased condition factor at polluted localities. Results suggest that counts of spleen macrophages and macrophage centres are good indicators of exposure to pollution in spottail shiners. Furthermore, infection by P. sinitsini in under polluted conditions appears to a greater negative impact on fish health than either stressor alone.",,,Biological Markers; Shiner,,2006,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imagines were collected throughout the mid-May to mid-September 1980 sampling period with most emergence occurring in spring and autumn. Over 95% of the emergence consisted of Hastaperla brevis and Malenka californica. Peak emergence of H. brevis occurred in late spring. Malenka californica had two different emergence patterns; at two stations, one in each stream, emergence began in midto late June and continued, intermittently, to the end of the sampling period with lowest emergence occurring during July and August. At all other stations, emergence was mainly restricted to late August and September. Sex ratios in each species were either approximately equal or there were generally more or only females collected. In species where large numbers of animals emerged, emergence of sexes overlapped. These are the first records of M. californica and Suwallia pallidula for the Province of Manitoba. INTRODUCTION Studies of insect emergence are valuable in providing information on diversity and seasonal occurrence of aquatic insects. Systematic studies of seasonal emergence of Plecoptera in Canada have been conducted in Quebec (Harper and Magnin, 1969; Harper and Pilon, 1970), Ontario (Sprules, 1947; Harper, 1973a, b; Harper and Hynes, 1972), Saskatchewan (Dosdall and Lehmkuhl, 1979) and Alberta (Radford and Hartland-Rowe, 1971; Donald and Anderson, 1977). No emergence studies of Plecoptera in Manitoba have been published. This paper describes an investigation of species composition, emergence periods, spatial distribution and abundance of adult Plecoptera, based on emergence data obtained over most of the open-water season, from two small, permanent streams in the Duck Mountain Region of W-central Manitoba. METHODS South Duck River (SD) and Cowan Creek (C), originate on the Manitoba Escarpment and flow into Lake Winnipegosis. The streams are spring-fed and are ice-covered in winter. Emergence trap stations were located on the Manitoba Escarpment (52048'N, 100040'W). Stations SD1, C1, C2 and C3 were located in areas with mixed forest (spruce, aspen, birch); the remaining stations were surrounded by forested and agricultural lands. Stream habitats ranged from fast-flowing riffle areas to siltbottomed pools. General features, including substrate types, of areas where emergence trap stations were located are listed in Table 1. Two 1 m2 emergence traps (Flannagan, 1978) were set at each station except at C4 where there was only one. One trap at each station was located over a riffle and the other over a pool, except at SD3 which had no pool areas and where both traps were located over riffle areas. Each trap was cleared every 2nd day and specimens were preserved in 70% alcohol. Sampling began 11 May 1980 and continued until 19 September 1980, except for Cl and C2 where sampling began on 21 May 1980.

These tailings are colonized by an active population of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans which is localized to an acid zone occupying 40% of the tailings' surface. This population peaked at 7 √ó 108 most probable number per gram of tailings during July and August 1990 and extended to a depth of 40 cm from the surface. Examination of samples over this depth profile by transmission electron microscopy and electron dispersive spectroscopy revealed a microbially mediated mineral transition from sulfides (below 40 cm) to chlorides and phosphates (at the surface). Silicate minerals were unaltered by microbial action. Transmission electron microscopy showed a tight association between Thiobacillus species and the sulfide minerals, which helps account for their prominence in tailings environments. Accurate enumeration of T. ferrooxidans from tailings required the disruption of their bonding to the mineral interface. Vortexing of a 10% aqueous suspension of the tailings material prior to most-probable-number analysis best facilitated this release. Even though heavy metals were highly mobile under acidic conditions at the Lemoine tailings, it was evident by transmission electron microscopy and electron dispersive spectroscopy that they were being immobilized as bona fide fine-grain minerals containing iron, copper, chlorine, phosphorus, and oxygen on bacterial surfaces and exopolymers.

The study was carried out in the forests surrounding Lake Duparquet, in the southwestern part of Qu√©bec's boreal forest. Stands representing different post-fire successional stages, corresponding to 278, 125, 79, and 51 yr since the last fire were selected.

PREMISE OF THE STUDY
In ecosystems where seed production is low and masting years are sporadic, or with species that have short-lived seeds, regeneration is assured by seedling banks rather than seed banks. Seedling establishment and survival play a critical role in determining the composition of these plant communities by supplying new individuals for their maintenance. Seedling emergence and mortality were investigated to test the hypothesis that recruitment into the seedling bank is periodic. ‚Ä¢


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Seed production and seedling emergence and survival was monitored during 1994-2007 in balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and white spruce (Picea glauca) in four pristine stands of the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. Measurements were collected twice per month by sampling one permanent plot of 20 √ó 20 m per stand. ‚Ä¢


KEY RESULTS
Seed-rain abundance reached 9 √ó 10(3) seeds m(-2) year(-1), and was characterized by synchronous sequences of low and high seed production. New seedlings appeared only during the year following a seed production of at least 1 √ó 10(3) and 1.5 √ó 10(2) seeds m(-2) year(-1) for balsam fir and white spruce, respectively. Seedlings emerged in July and survived 34-52 d on average, with balsam fir showing a longer lifespan and lower mortality, although 85-99% of seedlings died before completing one year of life. ‚Ä¢


CONCLUSIONS
The emergence of young seedlings was coupled with massive seed rains, which allowed synchronous replenishment of the seedling banks among stands and species, and generated different cohorts, yielding a discontinuous age structure.",,,Ninety Nine; Abies; Community; Bank (environment); Plant seeds; Balsams; Picea; Rain; Cessation of life; Seed Bank; Ecosystem; Seedlings,,1/12/2012,,8,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,"Abies balsamea, Picea glauca",1994-2007,,,,,,,,,,American Journal of Botany,2012,,
https://doi.org/10.1094/PHP-2011-0126-01-RS,Evaluation of a dynamic model for primary infections caused by Plasmopara viticola on grapevine in Quebec,"Downy mildew is major grape disease in several areas of the world. Recently, a dynamic model for primary infections of grapes by Plasmopara viticola, forecasting time of primary lesions emergence, was developed in Italy. The model simulates the development of predicted oospore cohorts during the primary infection period. The efficacy of this disease-cycle-based model was evaluated in eastern Canada by comparing the time of lesion emergence predicted by the model with field observations in 20 and 23 vineyards in 2008 and 2009, respectively. For each vineyard, one to 20 simulation runs were performed depending on the number of oospore cohorts expected to form, for a total of 545 simulations. The model evaluation was based on the true positive proportion (lesion emergence was predicted and observed) and the true negative proportion (lesion emergence was not predicted and not observed) which were 0.996, and 0.907, respectively. A total of 313 simulations resulted in no infection among which 284 corresponded to no lesion emergence. In only one situation, lesions were observed and not predicted by the model. On the contrary, in 29 simulations run, lesion emergence was predicted but not observed in the field. Further validation of this model is required, but the results of this study are encouraging and this model may be used to improve timing of fungicide sprays against P. viticola. Introduction In eastern Canada, as well as in several viticultural areas, downy mildew, caused by Plasmopara viticola (Berk et Curt.) Berlese et de Toni, represents one of the most important grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) diseases. The warm and wet spring with abundant rainfall generally occurring in the spring favor disease development (13). The pathogen, native to North America, infects most species of Vitis with vinifera cultivars being highly susceptible and wild species relatively resistant. The pathogen attacks all aerial parts of the vines, causing indirect losses (leaf, shoot, and tendrils infections, Fig 1A) or direct losses (berry infections, Fig. 1B). In addition, the quality of wine produced from infected grapes is reduced (21). Grape downy mildew epidemics can progress rapidly and can cause economic losses up to 100%; hence, growers attempt to limit this threat by managing their fungicide program as though a disease risk is always present. However, increasing fungicide, fuel, and labor costs make routine use of fungicides costly. This strategy has several disadvantages, not only from an economic point of view but also with regard to the environmental impact of fungicides. In this context, the use of decision-support systems and of simulation models that predict ‚Äúreal risk‚Äù represents a valid alternative to calendar-based fungicide spray program. 26 January 2011 Plant Health Progress Like most polycyclic diseases, epidemics of grape downy mildew entail a sequence of events initiated by the production and dispersal of initial inoculum, followed by primary infections, production and dispersal of secondary inoculum, and completed by survival of P. viticola. Recent molecular studies showed the preponderant effect of primary infections on the epidemic (8,9,24). Gobbin et al. (8,9) analyzed more than 10,000 isolates of P. viticola from 39 vineyards using microsatellite markers and found numerous infections originating from primary inoculum from May to August. Furthermore, they reported that genotypes identified once throughout the sampling period always constituted the dominant class (71% of all genotypes) regardless of the sampling date. Only one or two genotypes per epidemic developed into secondary cycles and generated a high number of progenies. In other words, epidemics of grape downy mildew are strongly influenced by primary inoculum and hence controlling them is crucial for adequate management of the disease. The relationship of temperature and relative humidity to downy mildew development and P. viticola reproduction serve as the basis for most prediction systems. Grape downy mildew prediction models have been proposed for identifying the periods of high risk (i.e. conditions are favorable for disease development) and for scheduling fungicide applications (16,23). Some of these models are based on the simulation of primary infection development such as the POM (26), EPI (25), SIMPO (10), DMCAST (20), and UCSC (23) models. While other models predict the development of secondary infections through a simulation of one or more stages of P. viticola biological cycle (3,6,15,18,19). Despite the availability of warning systems for management of grape downy mildew, Quebec‚Äôs growers generally apply fungicides in a preventative manner starting soon after the green tip phenological stage or based on the 3-10 rule (2). This rule is based on the concurrent occurrence of: (i) air temperature equal to or greater than 10¬∞C; (ii) vine shoots at least 10 cm long; (iii) a minimum of 10 mm of rainfall in the past 24 to 48 h. Considering the frequent spring to early summer occurrence of temperatures above 10¬∞C and rainfall, this rule basically relies on the phonological criteria (vine shoots at least 10 cm long) and does not accounts for the development of the pathogen. The objective of this study was to evaluate under the conditions of eastern Canada, the potential of a new dynamic model for predicting P. viticola development during the initial phase of the disease development (23) for predicting the emergence of the primary lesions. Model Description The model was previously described in detail (23). Briefly, it is a dynamic model developed following a mechanistic approach according to principles of systems analysis (22). The model simulates, with a time step of one hour, the entire process of downy mildew primary infection: oospore maturation and 26 January 2011 Plant Health Progress germination, then zoospore ejection and dispersal, and finally infection establishment and disease symptom onset. This process was separated into different stages: the pathogen changes from one stage to another at different rates, depending on environmental conditions (Fig. 2). Pathogen stages are considered as state variables and their changes are regulated by rate variables; weather conditions influence rates acting as parameters or intermediate variables. Hourly temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and rainfall (R) from 1 January were used as input data in the model. A simulation was initiated by each rainfall wetting the leaf litter and triggering the oospore germination process. In this model, it is assumed that oospores are present. At this time, the oospores which have broken dormancy form a cohort which develops in a similar way. An assumption of the model is that the germination process is temperature dependent when humidity of the leaf litter is not a limiting factor. The model simulates all the primary infection cycle of P. viticola (23). After germination, sporangia present on the leaf litter release zoospore in the presence of water; otherwise sporangia can survive for a few days and then die, depending on temperature and relative humidity. Zoospores are splashed by rain droplets and aerosols to grape leaves, but if the litter surface dries before rainfall zoospores do not survive. Infection establishment is caused by deposited zoospores when wetness duration and the corresponding temperature are favorable. If the leaf litter surface dries the zoospores dry out and die. The length of incubation period is influenced by temperature and relative humidity. At the end of the incubation period lesions develop at the infection sites. 26 January 2011 Plant Health Progress Field Observations The field observations used to evaluate the model were collected by government and private grape specialists and scouts in 20 and 23 vineyards in 2008 and 2009, respectively, located in the south of the province of Quebec, near the US border, and the north of the province (L‚ÄôIle d‚ÄôOrleans) (Fig. 3). Vineyards were selected based on availability of scouting data and the presence of susceptible cultivars. The vineyards selected for this evaluation are 26 January 2011 Plant Health Progress representative of the different grapevine-growing areas, for soil type, varieties, training systems and cropping regimes. They also represent a range of dose of overwintering inoculum because of different fungicide spray programs, environmental conditions and geographical locations. Starting from bud burst, each vineyard was inspected at a 3 or 4 day-interval, to detect the emergence of the first lesions expressed as ‚Äúoil spots‚Äù on leaves. At each assessment, all leaves on 50 to 100 vines, depending on vineyard size, were assessed for the presence of downy mildew lesions. Since the oil spots could have been appeared on each single day between the last negative and the first positive scouting, the actual symptoms onset was expressed as an ‚Äúonset window‚Äù (Fig. 4). 26 January 2011 Plant Health Progress Hourly temperature (¬∞C), relative humidity (%) and rainfall (mm) were obtained from the nearest (not more than 15 km) automatic weather station operated by Environment Canada available. The model was used to simulate, for each year and each vineyard, the progress of downy mildew for each predicted oospore cohort from 1 January to the emergence of the lesions (23). For a small number of vineyards located near to each other data from the same weather station were used. Methods for Model Evaluation For each vineyard, one to 20 simulations were performed depending on the number of oospore cohorts expected to be formed (presence of rain), for a total of 545 simulations. All simulations were divided into two groups based on observed lesion emergence; the cases and the controls were defined as the simulation with lesion emergence observed (O+) or not observed (O-), respectively. Within each group, simulations were further divided into two groups based on positive (P+) and negative (P-) prediction",,,,,2010,,8,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,Plasmopara viticola,,,,,,,,,,, Plant health progress,2011,,

The species is known to naturalize in northeastern North America and is documented in six New England counties in the Flora of the Northeast (Magee and Ahles 1999) and five counties in the Massachusetts County Checklist (Cullina et al. 2011). Weldy and Werier (2012) recorded the species in four counties in New York, and statewide records exist for all northeastern states excepting Rhode Island and New Hampshire (USDA, NRCS 2012).

This wetland complex is part of an extensive delta at the mouth of the Ausable River, a renowned trout stream that flows into Lake Champlain at the eastern edge of the Adirondack Park. An expanded search for E. ciliata found that the species is locally widespread, but especially abundant along the south bank of the river beginning around 600 meters downstream from the historic Carpenter‚Äôs Flats Bridge (Route 9, Peru, NY). Here the species has invaded an area of deep, sandy deposits covering more than 400 m.

,"Expanded concept of the milliped family Spirobolidae (Diplopoda: Spirobolida: Spirobolidea): Proposals of Aztecolini n. tribe and Floridobolinae/ini and Tylobolini n. stats.; re)descriptions of Floridobolus and F. penneri, both Causey, 1957, and F. orini","The endemic Floridian milliped genus, Floridobolus Causey, 1957, more closely related to tylobolinines in the western United States (US), Mexico, and Guatemala than syntopic spirobolines, is incorporated into Spirobolidae (Spirobolida: Spirobolidea). With taxonomic priority by one year, its monotypic family is reduced to Floridobolinae, n. stat., comprising Floridobolini and Tylobolini, n. stats., the counterpart to Spirobolinae, comprising Spirobolini and Aztecolini, n. tribe; relationships are Floridobolini + (Tylobolini + (Aztecolini + Spirobolini)). Like F. penneri Causey, 1957, 208 km (130 mi) to the south in the Lake Wales Ridge, Polk and Highlands counties (cos.), F. orini n. sp., inhabits ‚ÄúBig Scrub‚Äù environments in the Ocala National Forest, Marion Co. Biogeographic reconstructions, compatible with broader hypotheses on the class‚Äô evolutionary history, indicate that, from a presumptive source area in northern Mexico where the subfamilies overlap, spirobolid stock penetrated the ‚Äúproto-US‚Äù four times, once per tribe, before the Western Interior Seaway developed in the Cretaceous Period, Mesozoic Era. Three expansions headed northeastward into future ‚ÄúAppalachia,‚Äù from which taxa spread southward as the Seaway receded. Floridobolini, the fi rst invader, had to be in ‚Äúproto-Georgia‚Äù and positioned to penetrate Florida when the sand dunes that comprise the ‚ÄúCentral Highlands‚Äù emerged from the sea in the Oligocene (Cenozoic), ~25 mya. As sea levels rose and fell, the dunes fragmented into islands and the subcontinuous Floridobolus population was partitioned. The southernmost became F. penneri; F. orini inhabited a northern island; and a graduate student is investigating other insular remnants for additional species. Shortly after Floridobolini began spreading, Hiltonius/ Tylobolini arose and expanded both southward to Guatemala and northwestward to California; Tylobolus Cook, 1904, diverged in the latter area and dispersed northward to Washington and eastward to Utah/Arizona. The third invader, and the second to disperse northeastward, was Aztecolini, which probably eradicated Floridobolini from some of its established range and was partitioned into Mexican (Aztecolus Chamberlin, 1943) and US (Chicobolus Chamberlin, 1947) taxa by the Seaway. The fi nal invader, Spirobolini, dispersed northwestward and northeastward to both the Pacifi c and Atlantic coasts; instead of Trans-Beringia, we prefer penetration of the Asian part of ‚ÄúAsiamerica,‚Äù when it temporarily formed during the Cretaceous, to explain the Mongolian fossil genus, Gobiulus Dzik, 1975, herein assigned to Tylobolini, and the occurrence of Spirobolus Brandt, 1833, in China and Taiwan today. In the east, Narceus Rafi nesque, 1820, spread across Appalachia, eradicated most remaining populations of Floridobolus and Chicobolus, and expanded to Maine and Qu√©bec after retreat of the Wisconsin glaciation. Chicobolus and Narceus also penetrated earliest Florida; the former established itself in the Central Highlands, spread through the widening peninsula as sea levels fell, and remained on insular refugia when waters rose. Apparently fueled by the different Floridian environments, Narceus underwent time-consuming speciation; consequently, Floridobolus and Chicobolus still survive on the peninsula, and an allopatric population of the latter inhabits coastal South Carolina. However, N. gordanus (Chamberlin, 1943) occurs syntopically with both in peninsular Florida and may be actively eradicating them from their last stronghold. Trigoniulus niger, takahasii, and segmentatus, all by Takakuwa, 1940, are removed from Spirobolidae and returned toTrigoniulidae (Trigoniulidea). New records in the Appendix include the fi rst of Aztecolus from Durango and Jalisco, Mexico. 2 ‚Ä¢ INSECTA MUNDI 0357, April 2014 SHELLEY AND FLOYD",,,Stronghold; Meriones unguiculatus; Floridobolus; Spirobolida; Refugium; FOSSIL; Water; Population; Genus (mathematics); Mya,,2017,,5,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,milliped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Facteurs environnementaux et anthropiques influen√ßant la variation temporelle dans les √©chouages de mammif√®res marins de l'estuaire et du golfe du Saint-Laurent, Qu√©bec","RESUME: L'estuaire et le golfe du Saint-Laurent sont des aires d'alimentation estivales

De plus, des suivis a long terme de l'ecosysteme ont demontre des changements importants

marine mammals and thus, support annually many species. However, this marine 
ecosystem is under a strong anthropogenic pressure by various human activities (i. e. 
maritime traffic, fisheries, tourism etc .). Additionally, long- term monitoring of the 
ecosystem demonstrates considerable changes of environmental conditions. To identify and 
characterize the impact of these changes on the marine mammal community, we analyzed 
the occunence of stranding events from 1994 to 2008. Overall , the number of strandings 
and anthropogenic incidences increase annually and are higher in summer, season when 
human activities are particularly intense and when the majority of species are present. 
Environmental models show that water conditions (volume of the cold intermediate water 
layer, sea surface temperature, freshwater runoff) influenced stranding events in most 
species. lce coyer indeed influenced negatively the strandings of pagophilic seal species 
and mysticete. Krill abundance specifically influenced stranding even ts in harbour porpoise 
and minke whale. We identified in August 2008 an unusual event involving a high number 
of strandings of various species (beluga, harbour por-poise, harbour and grey seals). This 
event was caused by a bloom of toxic algae (Alexandrium tamarense) in the Estuary. 
Conceming the analysis of anthropogenic factors, we identified an increase of the number 
of entanglements mainly of minke and humpback whales, in some years exceeding the 
potential biological removal (PBR) of the minke whale stock of the Estuary and the Gulf of 
St. Lawrence. Three hypotheses were suggested to explain this tendency: i) bias in effort, 
ii) changes in the distribution of minke whales and iii) changes in fishery practices. We also 
observed an increase in anthropogenic events involving the harbour porpoise in the 
Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park. The nature of these events suggests illegal hunting. 
This project allowed to valid the use of strandings as a monitoring tool to demonstrate the 
influence of environmental changes and anthropogenic activities on the marine mammal 
community of the Estuary and the northwestern Gulf of St. Lawrence.",,,Linear algebra; Method of analytic tableaux; Biblioth√®que de l'√âcole des Chartes; Diethylstilbestrol,,1/10/2010,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,H,article,article,no,NA,"Map, geological feature",marine mammals (c.22 species),1994-2008,"source publication text, dataset",14,no,200000,no,abundance,,,,,,,

We tested three different hypotheses that might explain the co-occurrence of forested and unforested rock outcrops: (1) differences in bedrock geology, with unforested outcrops associated to bedrock types inimical to tree growth; (2) unforested outcrops as recently disturbed sites undergoing secondary succession towards a forested state; (3) unforested outcrops as an alternative stable state to forested outcrops, induced by post-fire regeneration failure. Digitized forest inventory maps were used along with bedrock geology maps and time-since-fire maps to compare forested and unforested outcrops for bedrock geology type and date of the last fire. Field surveys were conducted on 28 outcrops (14 forested, 14 unforested) to gather information regarding tree species composition and site characteristics (thickness of the organic matter layer, percent cover of lichens, mosses and ericaceous shrubs). None of the three hypotheses explain the co-occurrence of forested and unforested rock outcrops in the boreal forest of Qu√©bec. Both outcrop types occur on the same bedrock geology types. Unforested outcrops are not recently disturbed sites in early-successional states, as no clear distinction could be made in tree species composition and date of the last fire between the two outcrop types. Forested and unforested outcrops are not alternative stable states, as unforested outcrops are unstable and cannot maintain themselves through time in the prolonged absence of fire. Hence, unforested rock outcrops could be viewed as degraded, diverging post-fire types maintained by the late Holocene disturbance regime, characterized by high fire frequencies.",,,Forests; Succession; Control theory; Lichen - organism; Thickness (graph theory); Anytime algorithm; Occur (action); Unstable Medical Device Problem; Mosses; Geology; Word lists by frequency,,1/2/2006,,2,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,Landscape Ecology,2006,,No species information

It was likely introduced into southern Ontario at an international port on the Great Lakes in early 1970s, or possibly earlier in the 1960s. However, the exact location and date of introduction could not be precisely determined. The flea beetle has since dispersed northeastwards and reached Aylmer, north of Ottawa River, in Quebec, by 2003. This is about 375 km from Niagara Falls, where the oldest known specimens were collected in 1977. In 2009, various wild habitats and cultivated areas of Aylmer were surveyed. The host plants of the larvae could not be determined, but adults were swept from many plant species including various weeds and cultivated grasses: Alopecurus pratense (meadow foxtail), Dactylis glomerata (orchard-grass), Festuca rubra (red fescue-grass), and Poa pratensis (Kentucky blue-grass). Adults were also collected from flowers of several weeds: Aster sp. (undetermined species), Aster novae-angliae (New England aster), Ambrosia artemisiifolia (small ragweed), Echium vulgare (viper‚Äôs bugloss), Nasturtium officinale (water cress), Melilotus alba (white sweet-clover), Hypericum perforatum (common St. John‚Äôs-wort), Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife), Ranunculus acris (buttercup), and Solidago spp. (goldenrods). Since larvae are known to develop inside the roots and central stems of cereals, this new alien species represents a threat to Canadian agriculture, particularly if it reaches the Prairies in western Canada, where cereals represent a considerable part of their economy.

https://doi.org/10.2166/WQRJ.2002.009,Follow-up Studies Addressing Questions Identified During Cycle 1 of the Adult Fish Survey of the Pulp and Paper EEM Program,"The Canadian federal government instituted an environment effects monitoring (EEM) program for the pulp and paper industry to ensure the long-term integrity of fish populations below the discharge of mill effluents. The program is cyclical in nature (every three to four years) and one of the components of the program is an adult fish survey which monitors wild fish health in the receiving environments. Cycle 1 reports were submitted in April of 1996, and the report for the James Maclaren Inc. mill at Thurso, Quebec, suggested some responses were evident in fish downstream of the mill discharge. However, the receiving environment was subject to inputs from other potential sources or confounding factors such as farm runoff, storm sewers, municipal discharges and upstream paper mills. A review of other Cycle 1 studies also identified a number of problems encountered during the adult fish surveys. At this time, Maclaren researchers and Environment Canada set up a collaborative research project as part of their Cycle 2 studies at the Thurso site. Objectives of the study included a comparison of Cycle 2 results to their Cycle 1 studies, an assessment of the potential for the use of forage fish in the EEM program as well as an evaluation of reference site variability in the required EEM fish parameters. Collections in 1997 confirmed an increased male yellow perch liver size downstream of the discharge, but could not confirm reproductive alterations in exposed fish. It was possible to obtain all of the required EEM fish parameters from a small forage fish species such as the johnny darter, which may reduce the influence of fish mobility and other confounding factors on fish responses at some sites. Reference site variability was not a contributing factor in evaluating fish responses to effluent sources at this site.",,,,,1/2/2002,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,site IDs,NA,Map,yellow perch,1997-1998,source publication text,1,no,60,no,presence only,,,,Water Quality Research Journal,,,

The diet comprised a great variety of prey, with fishes well represented. Capelin (Mallotus villosus) and sand lance (Ammodytes sp.) together constituted most of the diet, (i.e., frequency of occurrence 66%, numerical frequency 68%, and volume 50%). Sand lance, which were nearly absent in regurgitations from the Estuary, were important in the diet of cormorants from the North Shore of the Gulf. At the North Shore colony, capelin were much more abundant in the diet in 1996 than in 1995, which correlates with independent fisheries data. In contrast to the results of previous studies of this cormorant's diet, our results show a preponderance of schooling fishes over benthic species.

https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12643,"Forage diversity, type and abundance influence winter resource selection by white‚Äêtailed deer","QUESTIONS: The presence of a plant species can influence the selection of another plant species by herbivores. Natural communities encompass several plant species, and in these multi‚Äêspecies environments, resource selection by herbivores could be partly explained by plant diversity. Our objective was to determine how winter consumption by a large herbivore (white‚Äêtailed deer) varies relative to the diversity and composition of the plant community in a temperate forest. (a) Does browsing increases or decreases with diversity indices; and (b) are specific community compositions linked to high or low browsing by deer? We also aimed to determine whether neighbouring plant diversity and identity could modify browsing on a specific species, Pinus strobus (hereafter pine). LOCATION: Vallee de la Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. METHODS: We sampled 102 plots in the sugar maple (Acer saccharum)‚Äìbasswood (Tilia americana) subdomain, a deciduous type of forest in the northern temperate zone. Each plot was centred on a pine and browsing by deer, plot diversity and composition were measured. RESULTS: Total browsing and browsing on focal pines decreased with increasing values of diversity indices, but only in plots with high resource abundance. This result is in accordance with optimal foraging principles, as diversified plots have a lower concentration of preferred species. Total consumption did not vary with plot composition, but browsing on the focal pine decreased with increased abundance of Diervilla lonicera and Lonicera canadensis, abundant deciduous shrubs. This associational defence could protect vulnerable pines from deer browsing. CONCLUSION: While our study revealed a relationship between plant community diversity and winter browse use and selection by deer, it also highlighted the importance of resource abundance and community composition ‚Äì variables influencing the resource selection process. Diversity measures can describe vegetation communities, but probably do not represent the way in which herbivores perceive their environment.",,,,,17/6/2018,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,appendix,pdf,no,NA,site coordinates,31 plant species,2014,source publication text,1,no,no,NA,abundance,,,,Journal of Vegetation Science,,,No information at all about the spatial extent and I cant even guess it
https://doi.org/10.2307/3802888,Foraging ecology and use of drumming trees by three-toed woodpeckers,"Among boreal forest bird species, the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) is closely associated with old-growth forests (>120 years), and possibly the most negatively affected by long-term changes induced by commercial forestry in eastern Canada. Part of this conflict is related to the woodpecker's use of standing dead trees as nesting sites. Moreover, this woodpecker's foraging behavior and its choice of feeding and drumming substrates may increase its vulnerability in managed forests. We describe foraging behavior of three-toed woodpeckers, and characterize foraging and drumming trees used by this species in Quebec's black spruce (Picea mariana) forests. During summer (May-Jul) and mid-winter (Jan-Feb), birds of both sexes used a highly specialized feeding technique consistent with searching for bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). Snags were highly preferred over live trees as foraging substrates. Snags used for foraging had a greater diameter at breast height (dbh) and were less deteriorated than paired nearest available snags. When live trees were selected for foraging, they also had a greater dbh but were more deteriorated than nearest available live trees. Thus, only a limited number of trees had all characteristics preferred by foraging woodpeckers, probably as a result of the ecology of its phloem-boring prey. Snags also were highly preferred over live trees as drumming substrates. Drumming snags differed from paired nearest available snags by having a broken top, less bark cover, and a lower deterioration class, which probably provided better acoustic towers for territorial birds. Given the extensive use of snags with different characteristics for foraging and drumming by three-toed woodpeckers, models estimating snag requirements for this species based only on nesting requirements are probably of limited use to maintain populations in managed areas. Wildlife habitat management objectives that specifically require the maintenance and renewal of snags in early decaying stages found in old-growth forests are essential to the conservation of this woodpecker species in managed forests.",,,,,2002,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,no,NA,"site coordinates, administrative unit","Picoides tridactylus, and 4 tree species (Black spruce, Jack pine, Basam fir, White birch)",1997-1998,source publication text,3,no,100,source publication text,presence only,,,,The Journal of Wildlife Management,,,

Results of research presented at the meeting are included in this special volume of Plant and Soil. The understanding of actinorhizal systems continue to increase, though work and use shops and discussions at this and similar meetings make it evident that this important subject remains open for fruitful investigation at all levels. Some important 'firsts' were reported at this meeting. The first extensive survey of Frankiae and their host specificity ranges from Asia was presented. This is of significance since Asia is a center of diversity for many actinorhizal host plant genera. A report that proto plasts of Frankia have been produced and regenerated for the first time improves the possibility for genetic manipulation of Frankia. It is also important to note the first report herein of successful mass inoculation of actinorhizal plants commercially for stabilization and reclamation of disturbed soils around hydroelectric power projects in Quebec. This heralds the transfer of actinorhizal technology to private and public users. The bacterial genus Frankia is easily recognized both in vivo and in vitro, and isolation of this organism has become routine.

High mortality rates were observed during the first two years of the program (2014: 22.5% [7/31], 2015: 55.0% [22/40]). Mortalities for both years were associated with an unusually high occurrence of coelomitis consecutive to a confirmed (N = 11) or suspected (N = 4) gastro-duodenal perforation. Microscopically, the coelomitis consisted of serosal mesothesial cell hypertrophy, fibrinous to granulomatous inflammation, visceral adhesions, as well as the presence of bacterial colonies and alimentary particles. Marked dilation of the gastrointestinal tract associated with abundant food material, suggestive of a digestive impaction/ileus, was frequently observed with the coelomitis cases. During the second year of the program, the increase in the quantity of food offered and the substitution of freeze-dried Gammarus shrimp with larger and more abrasive sun-dried red shrimps (Solenocera melantho) were identified as potential risk factors for gastrointestinal perforations and could account for the increased mortality rate observed.

Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) is an anadromous salmonid and the most harvested fish species by Inuit people, including in Nunavik (Qu√©bec, Canada), one of the most recently deglaciated regions in the world. Unlike many other anadromous salmonids, Arctic Char occupy coastal habitats near their natal rivers during their short marine phase restricted to the summer ice‚Äêfree period. Our main objective was to document putatively neutral and adaptive genomic variation in anadromous Arctic Char populations from Nunavik and bordering regions to inform local fisheries management. We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to genotype 18,112 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 650 individuals from 23 sampling locations along >2000 km of coastline. Our results reveal a hierarchical genetic structure, whereby neighboring hydrographic systems harbor distinct populations grouped by major oceanographic basins: Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay, and Labrador Sea. We found genetic diversity and differentiation to be consistent both with the expected postglacial recolonization history and with patterns of isolation‚Äêby‚Äêdistance reflecting contemporary gene flow. Results from three gene‚Äìenvironment association methods supported the hypothesis of local adaptation to both freshwater and marine environments (strongest associations with sea surface and air temperatures during summer and salinity).

https://doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-34.3.635,Ground-Dwelling Spider Fauna (Araneae) of Two Vineyards in Southern Quebec,"Abstract The spider fauna of vineyards in northern parts of North America are completely unknown, even though spiders represent important natural enemies to phytophagous insects occurring in vineyards. Weekly pitfall trapping in 1998 and 1999 in two vineyards in southern Quebec yielded over 4,600 spiders belonging to 97 species and 16 families. Spider assemblages (diversity and community composition) were similar between the two vineyards independent of environmental differences. However, some species-specific patterns were noted when the two vineyards were compared. High landscape diversity, including fallow fields and adjacent apple orchards, is hypothesized to account for a higher abundance of certain agrobiont species in one of the vineyards. Phenological data shows the most abundant linyphiid species, Tennesseellum formicum (Emerton), exhibits high phenotypic variation, and its multivoltine life cycles may be of adaptive importance for vineyards that are frequently disturbed. We also note several other species exhibiting period of peak activity in the spring [e.g., the wolf spiders Pardosa moesta Banks and Trochosa ruricola (De Geer)] or autumn [e.g., the funnel-web spider Agelenopsis potteri (Blackwall)]. Species turnover was high between sample dates, and data on activity and species richness of two guilds (web-building spiders and hunting spiders) indicate that many species that differ in foraging mode are active during all months of the growing season.

The present study examined a herd-level association between AMU and AMR in Escherichia coli (n=394) and Klebsiella species (n=139) isolated from bovine intramammary infections and mastitis cases on 89 dairy farms in 4 regions of Canada [Alberta, Ontario, Qu√©bec, and Maritime Provinces (Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick)]. Antimicrobial use data were collected using inventory of empty antimicrobial containers and antimicrobial drug use rate was calculated to quantify herd-level AMU. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using Sensititre National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) gram-negative MIC plate (Trek Diagnostic Systems Inc., Cleveland, OH). Isolates were classified as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant. Intermediate and resistant category isolates were combined to form an AMR category, and multivariable logistic regression models were built to determine herd-level odds of AMR to tetracycline, ampicillin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination, sulfisoxazole, streptomycin and kanamycin in E. coli isolates. In the case of Klebsiella species isolates, logistic regression models were built for tetracycline and sulfisoxazole; however, no associations between AMU and AMR in Klebsiella species were observed. Ampicillin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli isolates were associated with herds that used intramammarily administered cloxacillin, penicillin-novobiocin combination, and cephapirin used for dry cow therapy [odds ratios (OR)=26, 32, and 189, respectively], and intramammary ceftiofur administered for lactating cow therapy and systemically administered penicillin (OR=162 and 2.7, respectively). Use of systemically administered penicillin on a dairy farm was associated with tetracycline and streptomycin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli isolates (OR=5.6 and 2.8, respectively). Use of cephapirin and cloxacillin administered intramammarily for dry cow therapy was associated with increasing odds of having at least 1 kanamycin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli isolate at a farm (OR=8.7 and 9.3, respectively). Use of systemically administered tetracycline and ceftiofur was associated with cefoxitin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli (OR=0.13 and 0.16, respectively); however, the odds of a dairy herd having at least 1 cefoxitin-intermediate or -resistant E. coli isolate due to systemically administered ceftiofur increased with increasing average herd parity (OR=3.1). Association between herd-level AMU and AMR in bovine mastitis coliforms was observed for certain antimicrobials. Differences in AMR between different barn types and geographical regions were not observed.",,,"Cephapirin; Sulfisoxazole; Aminoglycosides; Dairy; Penicillins; Cefoxitin; Kanamycin; Chloramphenicol; Odds Ratio; Infection; Novobiocin; Antimicrobial Resistance; Klebsiella species; ceftiofur; Escherichia coli; Tetracycline Antibiotics; Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination; Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement; Streptomycin; Ampicillin; Sulfamethoxazole; Cattle; gram; Mastitis, Bovine; Cloxacillin",,1/8/2013,,2,semantic_scholar,,,,other,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bacteria resistance in farm herds
https://doi.org/10.25071/2292-4736%2F37681,"Hinterland's Who‚Äôs Who: Birding, Multiplicity, and Barn Owls","Full TextThe Barn Owl The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) is a medium-sized, tawny coloured owl that, with the exception of Antarctica, has worldwide distribution. Like most owls the Barn Owl is considered to be nocturnal. Like all owls, it is predatory bird. In the Barn Owl‚Äôs case, members of the species are said to enjoy (or specialize, in the biological parlance) in small ground mammals‚Äîrodents, for example. In Eastern North America, the majority of their diet would include Meadow Voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and Deer Mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Barn Owls strike a distinct-look with their lack of ear tufts (a misnomer of sorts as the tufts‚Äîthe ‚Äúhorns‚Äù of a Great Horned Owl, Bubo virginianus‚Äîare not ears and not associated with hearing at all) and their distinct heart-shaped facial disc (which is associated with hearing, but that‚Äôs another story for another time). As their common name suggests they can be found living in barns, on a nest made from the regurgitated un-digestible remains of those Meadow Voles and Deer Mice they hunt. Of course Barn Owls are not just limited to barns, but nest in silos, abandoned buildings and tree cavities too. Arguably, this should make their name ‚ÄúBarn, Silo, Abandoned Building & Tree Cavity Owl‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt really roll off the tongue in the same way. These attributes and distinguishing features are all things to keep in mind if you find yourself out birdwatching near a barn in Southern Ontario. During your explorations, while there are certain to be Rock Pigeons (Columba livia) fluttering about, if you happen to come across a Barn Owl in this setting, you should take notice. Seeing a Barn Owl in Southern Ontario (especially a living Barn Owl) is something to make special note of‚Äîit‚Äôs not a regular occurrence. Part of the significance of seeing a Barn Owl lies in its relative in-abundance. While individuals identified as Tyto alba enjoy a cosmopolitan reputation, Southern Ontario has been considered the northern range of the species (‚ÄúOntario Barn Own Recovery Project,‚Äù 2005) and it has been suggested that Barn Owls have always found, say, other places more to their liking. Because of this, the Barn Owl is a special bird in Canada: it is officially endangered, recognized by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) (‚ÄúOntario Barn Own Recovery Project,‚Äù 2005). It seems as though Barn Owls living in Ontario have had bad luck of late‚Äî of the ‚Äúhandful‚Äù (‚ÄúOntario Barn Own Recovery Project,‚Äù 2005 ¬∂ 4) that have been seen since 1999, two were roadkills (‚ÄúOntario Barn Own Recovery Project,‚Äù 2005) and no breeding pairs have been ‚Äúconfirmed.‚Äù The Barn Owl of February 27th 2006 If you are a serious birder in Ontario, with a computer and internet access, it is likely that you are aware of the electronic mailing list called Ontbirds. Ontbirds is presented by the self-proclaimed provincial birding association, the Ontario Field Ornithologists. The electronic mailing list (or listserv) is meant to be a clearing-house of bird sightings and directions for interested birders: you read about a bird you would like to see, get the directions and off you go on a (perhaps literal) wild goose chase. On average, four to seven sightings are posted daily. As might be expected, more posting occurs on the weekend, and more postings occur seasonally during spring and fall migration. Typical emails follow a standard form: the subject line contains the bird or birds seen and their location while the body of the email contains more specific information about the birds and precise directions to the location they might be found. While thorough, the information shared is, generally speaking, pretty uncontentious stuff. So, it was with interest that a seemingly normal post on February 28th, 2006 took on new dimensions: whispers of deception, accusation of fraud and, more interestingly for my work, questions of what is normal, known and natural all emerged. On February 28th, 2006, a simple posting appeared in mailboxes of subscribers outlining how a photograph had been taken of a Barn Owl and posted on a webbased photography site. A URL was given linking to the photograph. It was noted that the photographer had not reported seeing the bird on the Ontbirds listserv, but that there was a link to the location where the bird was seen. That same day, the moderator of the listserv posted reminding the subscribers that the Barn Owl was considered ‚Äúendangered‚Äù on breeding territory and that there were rules about posting about endangered birds on the listserv; all of the requirements that needed to be met prior to posting were created in order to reduce the likelihood that an observed bird would abandon a nest or breeding attempt. The following day, March 1st, a conversation had begun via the listserv. Another respondent was interested in knowing more details about the sighting and if the bird had been seen again. The next email later that day was from the photographer himself. In the email, he explained that though he did not remember exactly where he saw the bird, he used Google maps to locate the general location and road names. According to his directions, the Barn Owl was seen in Eastern Ontario, in the Ottawa region. As well, he shared the story of finding the owl, taking the photograph and watching the bird fly away from him. The author also stated that his initial reason for going out birding that day was to find Snowy Owls to photograph and that he had no luck in finding those birds that day. On March 2nd, another email arrived from another Ontbirds subscriber. In it, the author began to question the authenticity of the photograph. This email suggested that the owl‚Äôs feet have been ‚Äúdoctored,‚Äù as though something was removed after the photograph had been taken. The author reminded those reading that the Barn Owl is rare for Ontario and especially so where the photograph was taken‚Äîthe implication being that the bird is so rare that it most likely didn‚Äôt exist. A third email followed on March 2nd in which the author suggests that there is nothing in the photograph that appears unusual or doctored. The author offered another suggestion about the authenticity of the owl. He reminded us that there was a Barn Owl sighting in a different part of Ontario earlier in the winter and attributes the owl‚Äôs presence not to digital photographic magic, but to efforts undertaken on the part of humans to help the species recover. Yet, this claim to reality does not seem to be working. Later in the afternoon on March 2nd, a fourth email arrived that supports the initial hypothesis that the photograph has been doctored. The author shared that the bird looks like one he had seen at Parc Omega, a wildlife park in Qu√©bec, and provides a URL to a photograph of the Parc Omega Barn Owl. The pull of the network to make the photograph unauthentic, and in turn, the owl, continues to mount. In a fifth email, the author shared the contention that the fencepost the Barn Owl is pictured perching on was specially made for captive birds to land on. The author also suggested that given the lighting of the photograph and kind of weather that was observed on the day that the photograph was supposed to have been taken, the photograph could not be discounted as being genuine. This is where the conversation ends on Ontbirds. At 5:30 pm on March 2nd, the listserv co-ordinator posted a message that states that the current conversation on the photographed Barn Owl is inappropriate. The coordinator reminded readers that Ontbirds is not a discussion list and is for ‚Äúreporting birds period.‚Äù The closing line in the email reminds readers that not following the guidelines could result in the restriction or loss of being able to post to the listerv. This does not mean, however, that the conversation ended. In following the network thread to a website that catalogues rare birds from the Ottawa area, the sighting details for the Barn Owl seen on February 27th is prefaced with the words ‚ÄúLIKELY HOAX.‚Äù The page author outlines a litany of evidence that supports his claim that the image has been manipulated. The webpage author concludes his outline with the statement ‚Äúlet the viewer beware.‚Äù Enacting birds: reflection on the Barn Owl of February 27th I have spent some time thinking about the birders and the Barn Owl. I have read and reflected on the emails and the allegations. From this, themes have emerged concerning the construction of what is natural as well as insights into the creation of what Donna Haraway (2003) calls ""naturecultures."" Most importantly, this event, be it framed as authentic bird sighting or elaborate hoax, helps enact and make visible a topology of inter-species ethical relations between those who watch birds and the birds they watch. Networks Ontbirds operates within an established network of relations. People post their sightings to share with other interested birders. The process through which experiences are transcribed from embodied encounters to textual references is seemingly an invisible one. In this case, there were visible deviations from the established network. Within the birding community that posts to Ontbirds, the claim to have ""found"" a bird is an important one. In posts where the author is reporting a first-sighting and they did not find the bird themselves, the name of the bird finder (skilled, lucky or otherwise, as it is never suggested the kind of effort it took to come across the bird) is included. In this example, the finder did not make a submission to Ontbirds to report a rare bird. Rather, it seems like in this case, the original post came via an on-line gallery created by the finder that had the photograph and birding information on it. While never overtly stated, I believe that the authenticity of the Barn Owl was partially called into question due to the fact that the finder of the bird did not post his sighting to the listserv. Additionally, I find interesting to note that in the fin",,,"List of English terms of venery, by animal; Strigiformes; multiplicity",,16/11/2013,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,Tyto alba,,,,,,,,,,,UnderCurrents,2008,,

It has radiated into much of eastern North America (Wheeler and Stoops 1996; McCorquodale 1998; Ellis et al. 1999; Gardiner and Parsons 2005; Day and Tatman 2006), and its geographic range expansion had progressed to western Wisconsin by 2009 (Williams and Young 2009). We have monitored populations of lady beetles in eastern South Dakota over the past several years through 2009, but H. variegata was not detected (Hesler and Kieckhefer 2008; Hesler and Petersen 2008; unpublished data).

Hippodamia variegata was associated with English grain aphids and bird cherry-oat aphids in wheat, and with pea aphids in alfalfa in our survey. Previous surveys in other areas of North America recorded H. variegata from wheat and alfalfa (Ellis et al. 1999; Day and Tatman 2006). Potential prey in slender wheatgrass and the prairie was undetermined in our survey, but H. variegata has also been associated previously with plant species that occur in prairies (Ellis et al. 1999). The detection of H. variegata in South Dakota was unexpected this soon, as the nearest records of this species occurred approximately 400 km away in western Wisconsin in 2009 (Williams and Young 2009). The collections of 21 H. variegata during summer 2010 indicate that this species is now well established in Brookings County, South Dakota. In addition to weekly sampling of lady beetles in crop fields in Brookings County during the summer of 2010, other surveys for lady beetles in South Dakota did not find H. variegata at a nature preserve in Minnehaha County on 4 June or one in Beadle County on 31 July, suggesting a still limited local distribution. Additional surveys are needed to determine the extent to which H. variegata is present in South Dakota and to follow its geographic dispersion. Hippodamia variegata was released in Nebraska and several other Midwestern states, but not South Dakota, from 1987 to 1994 for intended biological control of the Russian wheat aphid (Flanders et al. 1991; Prokrym et al. 1998).

Since most knowledge of tree phyllosphere bacterial communities has been gathered in tropical forests, our goal was to characterize the community structure and assembly dynamics of phyllosphere epiphytic bacterial communities in temperate forests in Quebec, Canada. We targeted five dominant tree species: Acer saccharum, Acer rubrum, Betula papyrifera, Abies balsamea, and Picea glauca. We collected 180 samples of phyllosphere communities on these species at four natural forest sites, three times during the growing season.ResultsHost functional traits (i.e., wood density, leaf nitrogen content) and climate variables (summer mean temperature and precipitation) were strongly correlated with community structure. We highlight three key findings: (1) temperate tree species share a ‚Äúcore microbiome‚Äù; (2) significant evolutionary associations exist between groups of bacteria and host species; and (3) a greater part of the variation in phyllosphere bacterial community assembly is explained by host species identity (27¬†%) and species-site interaction (14¬†%), than by site (11¬†%) or time (1¬†%).ConclusionsWe demonstrated that host species identity is a stronger driver of temperate tree phyllosphere bacterial communities than site or time.

An ecologically and socially highly important northern terrestrial species that may be impacted by climate change is the caribou, Rangifer tarandus. We predicted the current and potential future occurrence of two migratory herds of caribou [Rivi√®re George herd (RG) and Rivi√®re‚Äêaux‚ÄêFeuilles (RAF) herd] under a Canadian General Circulation Model climate change scenario, across all seasons in the Qu√©bec‚ÄìLabrador peninsula, using climatic and habitat predictor variables. Argos satellite‚Äêtracking collars have been deployed on 213 caribou between 1988 and 2003 with locations recorded every 4‚Äì5 days. In addition, we assembled a database of climate (temperature, precipitation, snowfall, timing and length of growing season) and habitat data obtained from the SPOT VEGETATION satellite sensor. Logistic regression models indicated that both climatic and physical habitat variables were significant predictors of current migratory caribou occurrence. Migratory caribou appeared to prefer regions with higher snowfall and lichen availability in the fall and winter. In the summer, caribou preferred cooler areas likely corresponding to a lower prevalence of insects, and they avoided disturbed and recently burnt areas. Climate change projections using climate data predicted an increased range for the RAF herd and decreased range for the RG herd during 2040‚Äì2069, limiting the herds to northeastern regions of the Qu√©bec‚ÄìLabrador peninsula. Direct and indirect consequences of climate change on these migratory caribou herds possibly include alteration in habitat use, migration patterns, foraging behaviour, and demography, in addition to social and economic stress to arctic and subarctic native human populations.",,,Climate Change; Lichen - organism; Ecology; Labrador retriever; Demography; Impacted tooth; Residential gateway; Kerrison Predictor; Logistic regression; Habitat; Projections and Predictions; Reindeer; F-Spot; Ecosystem; General circulation model; Population; Terrestrial television,,1/10/2009,,5,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,article,article,administrative unit,NA,Map,"Rangifer

Some tree species, such as sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and ash (Fraxinus americana and/or F. pennsylvanica), have shown important increases since European colonization, while others have decreased sharply. In a site-by-site comparison, there are many instances where a species sold from a particular lot is completely absent from this lot today. Tamarack (Larix laricina) and black spruce (Picea mariana), two species that appear in the notary deeds, were completely eliminated from the studied lots. The apparent discrepancy between the predominance of lowlands in the landscape and the low presence in the notary deeds of tree species that prefer more humid conditions suggests that precolonial forests on the clay plain and lowlands were sparse or patchy or were composed of tree species of little stature or commercial value. For mesic sites, sales reported in the notary deeds suggest that the presettlement forest in the Haut-Saint-Laurent region corresponded to the maple-beech-birch forest type and that the most important change since European settlement is a loss or decrease in the abundance of American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis).

Natural enemies were sampled on milkweed infested with aphids, growing along the borders of ditches adjacent to cornfields. The sampling occurred weekly from June to September in 2006 and 2007, in the region of Lanaudiere (Quebec, Canada). The landscapes within a radius 200 and 500 m around each site were analyzed. The abundance, richness and species composition (based on functional groups) of natural enemies were related to landscape structure. The results indicated that landscape structure explained up to 21.6% of the variation in natural enemy assemblage and confirm the positive effects of non-crop areas and landscape diversity. A lower influence of landscape structure on species composition was observed (6.4 to 8.8%) and varied greatly among the functional groups. Coccinellidae and furtive predators were the group most influenced by landscape structure. In conclusion, the influence of landscape varied greatly among the different species of the same functional group.",,,Sampling (signal processing); Coccinellidae; Order Coleoptera; Ground state; Arthropods; Aphids; Online predator; Spiders,,6/11/2011,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,European Journal of Environmental Sciences,2011,,
,Influence of zooplankton stoichiometry on nutrient sedimentation in a lake system,"We explored rates and stoichiometry (C : N : P ratios) of sinking particles in a temperate reservoir during a 2-yr period. Plankton was sampled weekly, and a sediment trap placed below the metalimnion collected sinking particles. There were no significant relationships between the stoichiometry of entrapped material and seston or zooplankton stoichiometry. However the differences in the entrapped C : P and N : P ratios between consecutive trap samplings were negatively correlated with the time variations of the zooplankton C : P and N : P ratios. Zooplankton C : P and N : P ratios were positively correlated with the percentage of copepod biomass in total zooplankton biomass .250 mm and negatively correlated with the percentage of cladocerans. Zooplankton biomass .250 mm reduced the fraction of N and P primary production lost to sinking (export ratio). The residuals of the N export ratio versus zooplankton biomass relationship were negatively correlated with the zooplankton N : P ratio, whereas there was a positive relationship with the residuals of the P export ratio relationship. These observations support the hypothesis that the regulation of elemental homeostasis in the herbivorous zooplankton consumers occurs at least partly at the assimilation/egestion level. Elements ingested in excess‚ÄîP for the herbivorous copepods and N for many cladocerans‚Äîare concentrated into sinking feces, whereas the deficient elements are captured into biomass. In lakes, the vertical flux of small particulate matter essentially comprises two components: the sinking of ungrazed phytoplankton cells (e.g., Reynolds et al. 1982) and the sinking of the feces or fecal pellets of planktonic primary consumers (Sarnelle 1999). Both types of particles will settle from the upper layer below the thermocline if their sinking rates are higher than their mineralization rates. A simple heuristic model (Elser et al. 1995) explicitly represents the processes involved (Eq. 1). Sx 5 rz,xexgPx 1 rxsx(1 2 g)Px (1) 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed.

This work was supported by the National Fund for Scientific Research (Belgium). Sx is the sedimentation rate of the element x; rz,x is the fraction refractory to mineralization of the egested (ex), grazed (g) fraction of the production rate of element x (Px), and rx is the corresponding refractory fraction for the sinking (sx), ungrazed (1 2 g) fraction of the production rate of element x. For any given time interval, we can express the sedimentation rate as a fraction of elements incorporated by autotrophic activity during that interval. This fraction is referred to as the ‚Äò‚Äòexport ratio‚Äô‚Äô (ER; Eppley and Peterson 1979) and can be defined for any element x (ERx; Elser et al. 1995). 21 ER 5 (S P ) 5 r e g 1 r s (1 2 g) x x x z,x x x x ‚áî ER 5 r s 1 g(r e 2 r s ) (2) x x x z,x x x x This expression defines a relationship between export ratio and grazing intensity (g) in which ERx is a linear function of g with a y-intercept of rxsx and a slope of rz,xex 2 rxsx. The slope of this formula explicitly formalizes the influence of zooplankton on sedimentation of autotrophic production. Zooplankton, by its grazing activity, enhances the export ratio if the fraction of feces refractory to mineralization is 906 Darchambeau et al. Fig. 1. Location of the Esch-sur-S√ªre reservoir with morphometric and ecological summary information. The location of the sampling and sediment trap deployment station is indicated by S. higher than the refractory fraction of sinking phytoplankton cells (rz,xex . rxsx). However, in turn, zooplankton will decrease the export ratio if rz,xex , rxsx. The direction of the relationship between zooplankton (via its grazing) and sedimentation of particulate matter is thus dependent on (1) lake morphometry, which determines the fraction of phytoplankton that directly sediments (sx), (2) phytoplankton community characteristics (via rx and sx), and (3) zooplankton community characteristics (via rz,x and ex; Elser et al. 1995). The egested fraction of an element x (ex) is a function of the digestive ability of animals. Stoichiometric theory indicates that it could also be a function of consumer elemental needs (Sterner and Elser 2002). P-rich consumers, such as daphniids (Andersen and Hessen 1991; Hessen and Lyche 1991), have high demands of P from food; thus, the fraction of P egested from Daphnia must be lower than for genera with a lower P demand. In turn, copepods are rich in body nitrogen (N), and the fraction of N egested should be lower than for zooplankton species with a lower body N content. Moreover, apart from zooplankton stoichiometry, the fraction of feces refractory to mineralization (rz,x) also depends on their structure. Copepods surround their feces with a peritrophic membrane, which largely increases fecal cohesion and therefore the probability of sinking out of the epilimnion. So we can predict that copepods are likely to increase the export ratio of P and decrease the export ratio of N. However, for daphniid species, their effect on nutrient sedimentation will depend on the cohesion of their feces. If the feces sink before remineralization, we can predict a positive effect of daphniids on N sedimentation and a negative effect on P sedimentation. In this study, we monitored the elemental contents of seston, zooplankton, and settling particles in a mesoeutrophic lake during the annual period of stratification for 2 yr. We determined sinking of elements as a fraction of primary production to test the effects of zooplankton stoichiometry on vertical particulate-bound nutrient exports. Our results indicate that zooplankton biomass has a positive effect on N and P retention in the epilimnion and that zooplankton stoichiometry determines stoichiometry of settling particles. Materials and methods Field data acquisition‚ÄîThis field study was conducted in the Esch-sur-S√ªre reservoir in Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. A map and a summary of morphometric and ecological characteristics are provided in Fig. 1. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (1982) classification, the reservoir is considered a mesoeutrophic waterbody (Dohet and Hoffmann 1995). The survey was conducted at a station (maximum depth 30 m) located in the middle of the lake, representative of whole lake conditions (Thys et al. 1998). Seston and zooplankton were sampled weekly during the period of stratification (roughly from April to October) in 1999 and 2000. Lake stratification was determined weekly according to the temperature and oxygen vertical profiles obtained with a Hydrolab DS-4 multiprobe. The lower limit of the epilimnion was at 2‚Äì3 m in early May and continuously deepened until it was at 11‚Äì14 m in late September. The lower limit of the metalimnion started at 7‚Äì8 m in May and deepened to 17‚Äì20 m in September. Zooplankton was sampled with a 17-cm diameter, 250-mm mesh net towed vertically in the epilimnion. Six zooplankton samples for elemental analysis were collected on each sampling occasion and immediately filtered on preignited (12 h at 5008C), preweighted Whatman GF/C filters and directly frozen in dry ice. Epilimnetic zooplankton was additionally sampled with a 50-cm diameter, 50-mm mesh net to determine community composition and densities. Triplicate samples were collected and pooled to reduce heterogeneity in zooplankton horizontal distribution and sampling variability. The collected zooplankton was immediately narcotized in soda water, rinsed, and preserved within 4% formalin (Haney and Hall 1973). For seston analysis, a pooled sample was constituted on each sampling occasion from discrete samples (3 liters) collected with a Ruttner bottle and spaced every meter in the epilimnion. Another pool was constituted for the metalimnion. From each pool, one subsample of 1‚Äì2.5 liters were filtered on a Whatman GF/C filter and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen for pigment analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and six subsamples of 0.15‚Äì0.5 liters were filtered on preignited Whatman GF/C filters and directly frozen in dry ice for elemental analysis. A sediment trap was deployed at the top of the hypolimnion, and its deployment depth (8‚Äì21 m) was adjusted every 2 weeks according to the thermal and oxygen stratification of the water column. The trap consisted of one 15.4-cmdiameter, 133-cm-long polyvinyl chloride collection tube suspended from a floating pontoon. The trap was initially filled with GF/C-filtered lake water taken at the immersion depth of the trap. One liter of an inhibitory, high-density solution (180 mmol L21 HgCl2, 10% w/w NaCl) was added with the use of a small tube at the bottom of the trap. This solution inhibits the breakdown of entrapped material without catching swimmers (Lee et al. 1992; data not shown). The trap was recovered every 2 weeks, and the upper 4 liters were discarded. The remaining volume (;20 liters) was carefully poured into a large basin and gently mixed. The 907 Zooplankton and nutrient sedimentation water was filtered through a 250-mm Nitex screen, and six subsamples of particles ,250 mm were collected for elemental analysis on preignited Whatman GF/C filters. In addition, lake water was collected with a Ruttner bottle at the same depth as the trap immersion depth and submitted to the same procedures to correct trap contents for ambient par-",,,"Phytoplankton; Feces; Polyvinyl Chloride; Immersion (virtual reality); Sedimentation procedure; Heuristic; Elemental; Stratification; Zooplankton; Mercuric chloride; Plankton; Sodium Chloride; Physiologic calcification; Sampling (signal processing); Dry Ice; Morphometrics; Ephrin Type-B Receptor 1, human; Xor-encrypt-xor; Sediment; Oxygen; National Fund for Scientific Research; Homeostasis; Data acquisition; List of Code Lyoko episodes; Copepoda",,2005,,8,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,Zooplankton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"not distinction of species, only biomass data"

https://doi.org/10.1007/S10980-021-01300-Z,Insectivorous songbirds as early indicators of future defoliation by spruce budworm,"
 
 Although the spatiotemporal dynamics of spruce budworm outbreaks have been intensively studied, forecasting outbreaks remains challenging. During outbreaks, budworm-linked warblers (Tennessee, Cape May, and bay-breasted warbler) show a strong positive response to increases in spruce budworm, but little is known about the relative timing of these responses.
 
 
 We hypothesized that these warblers could be used as sentinels of future defoliation of budworm host trees. We examined the timing and magnitude of the relationships between defoliation by spruce budworm and changes in the probability of presence of warblers to determine whether they responded to budworm infestation before local defoliation being observed by standard detection methods.
 
 
 We modelled this relationship using large-scale point count surveys of songbirds and maps of cumulative time-lagged defoliation over multiple spatial scales (2‚Äì30¬†km radius around sampling points) in Quebec, Canada.
 
 
 All three warbler species responded positively to defoliation at each spatial scale considered, but the timing of their response differed. Maximum probability of presence of Tennessee and Cape May warbler coincided with observations of local defoliation, or provided a one year warning, making them of little use to guide early interventions. In contrast, the probability of presence of bay-breasted warbler consistently increased 3‚Äì4¬†years before defoliation was detectable.
 
 
 Early detection is a critical step in the management of spruce budworm outbreaks and rapid increases in the probability of presence of bay-breasted warbler could be used to identify future epicenters and target ground-based local sampling of spruce budworm.

How does the abundance or richness of one vegetation layer affect the abundance or richness of the other? Location: Boreal mixed-wood forests of Ontario and Quebec, Canada. Methods: We sampled fire-origin stands of varying overstorey composition from broad-leaf-dominated to mixed to conifer-dominated stands on mesic sites in Ontario and subhydric sites in Quebec. Overstorey tree species composition and understorey shrub, herb, bryophyte and lichen species cover and richness were estimated within 400-m 2 circular plots. In addition, soil nutrients, coarse woody debris and light conditions were measured. Overstorey composition was expressed as the percentage basal area of broad-leaf tree species. Path analysis was used to examine interactions among the forest layers. Results: Overstorey broad-leaf composition had positive effects on shrub and herb layer cover and herb layer richness, and negative effects on bryophyte and lichen species cover and richness. Shrub layer cover had no effect on herb layer cover, but shrub layer richness had a positive effect on herb layer richness. Herb layer cover and richness had negative effects on bryophyte species cover and richness. Bryophyte cover had no effect on lichen cover, but its richness was positively related to lichen richness. In both regions, soil pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and cation exchange capacity of the forest floor were positively correlated with overstorey broad-leaf composition and with shrub layer cover and herb layer cover. Conclusions: Increasing overstorey broad-leaf composition, through its influence on soil nutrients, promotes shrub and herb layer species, but limits bryophyte and lichen species. In the overstorey-controlled understorey resource environment, cover and richness of shrub and herb layers increase with resource availability, whereas bryophytes and lichens show positive associations with abundance of coarse woody debris.",,,,,1/5/2013,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,plant communities,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of Vegetation Science,2012,,

A systematic 2-yr survey showed Amblyseius fallacis (Garman), Typhlodromus caudiglans Schuster (Acari: Phytoseiidae), and Agistemus fleschneri Summers (Acari: Stigmaeidae) to be the most abundant species. Other phytoseiids, Typhlodromus conspicuous (Garman), Typhlodromus herbertae Chant, Typhlodromus longipilus Nesbitt, Typhlodromus bakeri (Garman), Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten, Amblyseius okanagensis (Chant), and Amblyseius finlandicus (Oudemans), were found in low numbers. Two of these species, A. finlandicus and T. conspicuus, were identified for the first time in Quebec. Other occasional species included Anystis baccarum (L.) (Acari: Anystidae) and Balaustium sp. (Acari: Erythraeidae). Tetranychid mite numbers were always less than two mites per leaf throughout the study, and none of the commercial orchards required an acaricide treatment. A notable aspect of this study was that seasonal totals for A. fleschneri and A. fallacis decreased 7.3- and 42.2-fold, respectively, whereas T. caudiglans increased 9.1-fold from 1999 to 2000.

,Laboratory diagnosis of rabies in Canada for calendar year 2006.,"The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), with laboratories in Ottawa, Ontario (Centre of Expertise for Rabies) and Lethbridge, Alberta, conducts rabies testing in Canada on all suspect rabid animals where there was human or domestic animal contact and for all human suspect cases (diagnostic submissions). In addition, individual provinces may contract with the CFIA to provide diagnostic support for intensified surveillance programs (survey samples). The majority of all submissions are tested by the fluorescent antibody test (FAT) (1), the method recommended by the World Health Organization for the routine diagnosis of rabies (2). In addition, diagnostic submissions where there was documented human contact and a negative FAT are subject to a second, confirmatory test, the rabies tissue culture inoculation test (RTCIT). Although not preferred as a method for routine rabies diagnosis, formalin-fixed samples can be tested by using an avidin-biotin complex (ABC) immunohistochemistry test (3). 
 
In 2006, 7201 diagnostic submissions were received for testing. An additional 1872 survey samples were tested as part of surveillance programs carried out by the provinces of Ontario and Quebec (Table 1). A small proportion of the diagnostic submissions were unfit for testing by the FAT (n = 86) or ABC (n = 1). Of the submissions fit for testing, 229 were positive for rabies virus antigen by the FAT: 227 from the diagnostic submissions and 2 from the Quebec survey. While these data represent a decrease in the total number of annual rabies cases compared to each of the previous 5 y, the percent of positive submissions has not changed greatly over this time (2002 ‚Äî 4.0%, 2003 ‚Äî 3.2%, 2004 ‚Äî 3.4%, 2005 ‚Äî 3.6%, 2006 ‚Äî 3.2%). Diagnostic submissions tested by ABC (n = 6) or RTCIT (n = 5363) in 2006 were all negative for rabies. 
 
 
 
Table 1 
 
Rabies diagnosis in Canada for 2006 
 
 
 
The majority of diagnostic submissions originated from the provinces of Ontario and Quebec (76.3%), followed by the Western provinces (19.3%), the Atlantic provinces (3.6%), and the Northern territories (0.7%). The largest numbers of positive cases originated from Ontario (n = 82), Manitoba (n = 65), and Saskatchewan (n = 33). Although Quebec submitted the 2nd largest number of submissions, only 0.6% were positive for rabies, in contrast with the results for Ontario (2.4%), Manitoba (12.7%), and Saskatchewan (11%). There were no rabies cases in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, or the Yukon. However, submission numbers from these regions were low ‚Äî fewer than 50 for 4 of the 5 regions. As such, it is probable that the true rabies burden in these regions is not reflected in these statistics. In particular, there were only 3 submissions from the Yukon. This article and Blanton et al (4) suggest that, given the prevalence of rabies in the Northwest Territories and Alaska in 2006, it is likely that there is rabies in the Yukon. 
 
The species that tested positive for each province and territory are listed in Table 2. Of these, 45.4% were wild carnivora (striped skunks [Mephitis mephitis] were most abundant), 31.4% were bats (big brown bats [Eptesicus fuscus] were most abundant), and 23.1% were domestic animals (cattle [Bos taurus] were most abundant). As observed in previous years, there was a regional distribution with respect to the species of the positive cases. Not unexpectedly, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut did not have any bat rabies, but did record cases in arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), as well as in dogs (Canis domesticus). Positive bats were found in all provinces with rabies cases. Species affected included big brown, little brown (Myotis lucifugus), silver-haired (Lasionycteris noctivagans), hoary (Lasiurus cinerus), California (M. californicus), and long-eared (M. evotis) bats. All rabies cases from British Columbia and Alberta were in bats, with the exception of 1 rabid cat (Felis domesticus) found in Alberta. Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec all had cases in wildlife other than bats, as well as in domestic animals, including cats, dogs, cattle, horses (Equus caballus), and 1 sheep (Ovis aries). In addition to the animal submissions, 5 suspect human rabies cases were tested by FAT, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, or both; all tests were negative for rabies.

Rabies testing by species and province/territory in Canada for 2006 ‚Äì diagnostic submissions 
 
 
 
Submissions that tested positive for rabies were identified by antigenic typing using panels of monoclonal antibodies that distinguish between the common variants known to circulate in Canada (5,6). In general, bats that tested positive for rabies carried the variants commonly associated with the given bat species. Two variants continue to circulate in skunks found in Canada. In Saskatchewan and Manitoba this is the Western skunk virus variant and in Ontario this is the Arctic variant normally associated with arctic and red foxes. While the Arctic variant has been controlled in red foxes in Ontario by using the ERA oral vaccine (7), the striped skunk, which remains refractory to immunization with ERA, has become a reservoir of this variant in the south-western area of the province, centered in Wellington and Grey counties (8). The impact of the epizootic of rabies in skunks in Ontario is clear: In 2006 all of the cases of rabies in domestic animals in this province (n = 14), as well as the cases in red fox and raccoon (Procyon lotor) (n = 3), were from this region, and were all due to the Arctic variant. Likewise, in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the spillover of rabies into domestic animals was due to infection caused by the Western skunk variant. Two cases of spillover of rabies from bats were found in 2006; the first was a cat in Alberta that was infected with a variant associated with little brown bats, the second was a skunk from Quebec infected with a variant associated with big brown bats. Not surprisingly, the dogs and foxes that tested positive from the Northwest Territories and Nunavut and 2 dogs from northern Quebec had the Arctic variant. 
 
In May 2006, a raccoon, found in southern Quebec near the Vermont border, tested positive for rabies virus that was typed as the mid-Atlantic raccoon variant. This represented a new incursion of this variant into Canada since the last reported case of raccoon-variant rabies was in eastern Ontario in September 2005. A subsequent surveillance program initiated by the Quebec government identified an additional 2 raccoons harbouring the mid-Atlantic raccoon variant in June. Another raccoon that tested positive for rabies (also mid-Atlantic raccoon variant) was reported in November. This epizootic has grown to more than 60 cases identified in 2007, including raccoons, skunks, and 1 red fox, infected with the raccoon-variant rabies virus. 
 
The rate of positive submissions was consistently higher for cases involving no human contact versus those involving human contact as reported by the veterinary investigator (Table 3). This was true for all the species categories (bats, other wildlife, domestic animals). Of the 229 positive submissions in 2006, more than half (n = 118) originated from animals where there was no known human contact, despite the fact that 76% of the diagnostic submissions were animals reported to have had human contact. Thirty-eight percent of the positive results with no human contact (45/118) also did not have any reported domestic animal contact. In addition, the positive specimens with no human contact originated from 96 counties in Canada, while those with a history of human exposure represented only 70 counties. With respect to understanding rabies epidemiology in Canada, there is substantial benefit to be gained from testing animals that are exhibiting clinical symptoms consistent with rabies, regardless of whether they pose a direct health risk to humans or domestic animals. A true picture of the rabies burden, obtained by comprehensive testing, is necessary for efficacious and cost-effective control measures to be implemented.

Experimental studies were designed to reproduce treatment plant and distribution system conditions (chlorine dose, water temperature, pH and water residence time). Differences in halogenated DBPs in the two distribution systems under study were significant and comparable to those observed in experimental laboratory studies. For the waters of both utilities, chlorination studies better reproduced the occurrence of halogenated DBPs in points of the distribution system located near the treatment plant (low residence time of water) than in other points. Multivariate regression models for THMs, HAAs and their species were developed using the data from experimental studies in order to predict halogenated DBP levels measured in the distribution system. Models were all statistically significant, but showed low ability to predict full-scale halogenated DBPs, particularly in points located at distribution system extremities. Specifically, experimental chlorination-based models are not able to simulate the decrease of HAA levels.

,low responses of understory plants of maple-dominated forests to white-tailed eer experimental exclusion m√©lie Collarda,"We examined the response of understory plants in mature maple-dominated forests of southern Qu√©bec, Canada, following about 30 years of high deer densities, using a deer exclosure experiment. An exclosure and a paired control of 625 m2 each were established on six sites in 1998. An exclosure and a paired control of 16 m2 were added at each of the same sites in 2003 but under a recent canopy gap to determine if light could enhance plant responses. We measured plant richness and abundance, and aboveground biomass of different plant groups for 8 years in the understory plots and for 3 years in the canopy gaps. Four herbaceous species were also monitored individually in the same plots. No significant differences between treatments were found in plots under forest cover, except for lateral obstruction at 0‚Äì50 cm height which was higher in the exclosures. Under canopy gaps, however, tree seedling and total plant abundance were higher in deer exclosures than in control plots. Trillium erectum recovered partially as individuals were taller, had larger leaves and more frequently produced a flower or a fruit in the absence of deer browsing under forest cover. To a lesser extent, Erythronium americanum and Maianthemum canadense also exhibited signs of recovery but were still at the single-leaf stage after 8 years of recovery. In general, the different plant groups exhibited little recovery following deer exclusion, possibly because of the low light levels that prevailed in the understory of undisturbed maple-dominated forests. The higher latitude of the present study could also contribute to the slow recovery rates of the different groups of plants compared to studies conducted in northeastern USA. Variability among sites and years had an effect on detection of statistically significant differences. Trends are however appearing over time, suggesting that many understory plants are recovering very slowly following deer exclusion.

The main objective of this paper is to show that a well-managed lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens population can support a high and sustainable commercial catch, even in the Great Lakes drainage where the species has nowadays become rare. In a 350-km long un-fragmented stretch of the lower St Lawrence River located between Montreal and downstream Quebec City, with declared annual catches of 150¬†tonnes, the lake sturgeon population was considered overexploited by a governmental scientific committee in 1987 on the basis of high annual mortality rates (17‚Äì25% for age groups 14‚Äì31), unbalanced age structure, deficit of reproductive potential and commercial catch yields well over 1.5¬†kg¬†ka‚àí1. A first management plan implemented in 1987 failed to reduce the catch and provide more protection to the spawning stock. During the 1990s, the declared catch of the 76 commercial fishermen kept increasing over 200¬†tonnes. The age at the recruitment of the 20-cm-mesh gill-nets shifted towards older fish, indicating a decrease in the numbers of younger fish. In the population, sub-adult abundance decreased by 60%, as well as the year-class strength and the abundance of the females on the largest known spawning ground. In 2000, a stronger management plan was then enforced in order to adapt the total catch to the potential of the resource. The commercial catch was reduced by 60% in 3¬†years and an individual code-bar plastic tag and a code-bar weight declaration coupon were established to control its application. The fishing season was also shortened. Ten years later, we are confident in maintaining the actual commercial fishery because the commercial catch is now much lower (80¬†tonnes) and is more effectively controlled, the abundance of juvenile lake sturgeon increased throughout the St Lawrence River and the regular yearly production of cohorts has been demonstrated. Restrictive management measures, close supervision of landings combined with periodic monitoring of the population are key elements in managing this long-lived species. We also emphasize the importance of preventing any further fragmentation of this portion of 350¬†km of fluvial habitat as well as to maintain habitat quality to ensure the sustainability of this fishery.",,,,,1/4/2011,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,article,article,"administrative unit, geographic feature",NA,"Map, administrative unit, geographic feature",Acipenser fulvescens,1995-2008,source publication text,13,no,no,NA,abundance,,,,Journal of Applied Ichthyology,,,

 Background: Short-term effects of silvicultural treatments on soil properties and understory vegetation in temperate hardwood forests are well documented, but few studies have examined longer term effects of treatment intensity. We hypothesized that short-term effects of silvicultural treatments on understory plant diversity do persist over the medium-term (20 years after treatment); the magnitude of these effects would be proportional to the intensity of canopy and soil disturbance.Methods: Soil properties (pH, total C and N, extractable P, exchangeable bases) and understory community diversity indices were measured in six experimental sites along a longitudinal gradient that covered different climatic and edaphic conditions in the yellow birch-sugar maple bioclimate domain. Reference condition, i.e. control forest with no anthropogenic disturbance for at least 80 years (CON) were compared to twenty years old regeneration treaments representing a gradient of canopy and soil disturbance intensity: single-tree selection cuts (SIN); group-selection cuts (GRP); and group-selection cuts with scarification (GRPS). Results: Geographic location of sites explained more variation in soil properties and community composition than did treatments. Species richness in both group-selection treatments was higher than that in CON forests. However, understory plant equitability and beta diversity among sites in GRP and GRPS were lower than in SIN and CON forests. More intense treatments (GRP and GRPS) increased the relative occurrence of vegetatively reproducing heliophilic plants, a trait syndrome associated with adaptations to disturbed environments. These treatments also contributed to the medium-term persistence of recalcitrant competitor species (e.g., Rubus idaeus, Prunus pensylvanica) whereas soil scarification appears to have negative sustained effects on species known to be sensitive to regeneration treatments (e.g. Monotropa uniflora, Dryopteris spinulosa).Conclusion: Of the treatments studied, single-tree selection cutting appears to be the most appropriate silvicultural treatment for maintaining soil functions and heterogeneous understory plant communities with compositions and structures similar to natural forests, while more intense treatments rather maintain and expand species that are better adapted to a wider range of environmental conditions, including open environments.",,,,,29/6/2021,,5,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research Square,2021,,
,Modelling individual tree mortality: Tests using the growth efficiency concept with black spruce stands,"There exists no universal method to model individual tree mortality due to the competition between individual trees. Simulation models often pursue different goals, ranging from the prediction of growth and yield to testing of theories of forest dynamics. Hawkes (2000) recently pointed out that one of the most promising approaches to predict tree mortality consists of using the growth efficiency (E) concept. E is defined as stem growth per unit of projected leaf area (leaf area index, LAI) and is therefore a measure of growth relative to the part of the plant responsible for carbon capture, and thus indicating variations in productive capacity. E has been suggested as a variable that can be interpreted from a biological and physiological point of view. E has the following advantages in simulating mortality (Hawkes 2000): 1) Low E is associated with a woody plant‚Äôs inability to accumulate reserves and is a sign of a stressed tree. 2) As a relative measure, E is not site-specific; 3) E is not species-specific because in conditions of scarce resources the plant with the lower E will suffer more whatever the species. 4) E acclimatises to climate change so mortality will not necessarily be catastrophic under different climate scenarios. 5) E tends to decline with time, age and size, representing declining vigour without having to define any age or size parameters. 6) E can be higher in trees under competitive stress. The objective of this study was to test and apply the concept of growth efficiency in a model aimed at predicting individual tree mortality in Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) dominated stands located in Quebec (Mailly et al. 2003). To achieve this goal 4 different locations were selected north of Quebec City in the R√©serve Faunique des Laurentides. Within each location, two different sites were sampled (rich and poor) for a total of 8 sampling units. In each sampling unit, a pair of dominant, codominant, intermediate and suppressed trees were harvested using standard stem analysis and tree architecture techniques. In each pair, one tree with a live crown ratio > 70% and one with a live crown ratio < 30% were selected. The poster will show the upcoming results from this study in which the growth efficiency of each tree was reconstructed and inferences about the likelihood of mortality were made through a modelling approach.",,,Sampling (signal processing); Picea; Trees (plant); Sampling - Surgical action; Projections and Predictions; Crown group; Simulation,,2004,,8,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://doi.org/10.3390/f11010003,Modelling Post-Disturbance Successional Dynamics of the Canadian Boreal Mixedwoods,"Natural disturbances, such as fire and insect outbreaks, play important roles in natural forest dynamics, which are characterized over long time scales by changes in stand composition and structure. Individual-based forest simulators could help explain and predict the response of forest ecosystems to different disturbances, silvicultural treatments, or environmental stressors. This study evaluated the ability of the SORTIE-ND simulator to reproduce post-disturbance dynamics of the boreal mixedwoods of eastern Canada. In 1991 and 2009, we sampled all trees (including seedlings and saplings) in 431 (256 m2) plots located in the Lake Duparquet Research and Teaching Forest (western Quebec). These plots were distributed in stands originating from seven wildfires that occurred between 1760 and 1944, and which represented a chronosequence of post-disturbance stand development. We used the 1991 inventory data to parameterize the model, and simulated short- to long-term natural dynamics of post-fire stands in both the absence and presence of a spruce budworm outbreak. We compared short-term simulated stand composition and structure with those observed in 2009 using a chronosequence approach. The model successfully generated the composition and structure of empirical observations. In long-term simulations, species dominance of old-growth forests was not accurately estimated, due to possible differences in stand compositions following wildfires and to differences in stand disturbance histories. Mid- to long-term simulations showed that the secondary disturbance incurred by spruce budworm did not cause substantial changes in early successional stages while setting back the successional dynamics of middle-aged stands and accelerating the dominance of white cedar in late-successional post-fire stands. We conclude that constructing a model with appropriate information regarding stand composition and disturbance history considerably increases the strength and accuracy of the model to reproduce the natural dynamics of post-disturbance boreal mixedwoods.",,,,,18/12/2019,,2,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,no,NA,range coordinates,"balsam fir, white birch, white spruce, trembling aspen, eastern white cedar ",1991-2009,source publication text,2,no,no,NA,"presence only, abundance",,,,Forests,,,
https://doi.org/10.1139/B05-012,Molecular markers indicate that the narrow Qu√©bec endemics Rosa rousseauiorum and Rosa williamsii are synonymous with the widespread Rosa blanda,"Rosa rousseauiorum Boivin and Rosa williamsii Fern. are two rare roses in eastern Quebec, whose taxo- nomic status is controversial. Morphological characters alone do not clearly differentiate these two taxa from each other or from the morphologically variable and widespread Rosa blanda Ait. We evaluated the taxonomic status of these two taxa, and of two other R. blanda segregates, Rosa subblanda Rydb. and Rosa johannensis Fern., through an analysis of RAPD, ISSR, and AFLP markers. We surveyed 86 individuals from 36 populations in eastern North Amer- ica. Despite a high degree of polymorphism, principal coordinate analyses and the weighted pair group method with arithmetic averaging suggest no clustering of individuals that correspond to taxonomic boundaries. However, the closely related Rosa palustris Marsh. is clearly differentiated from the R. blanda s.l. taxa. When populations of R. blanda west of Quebec are included, the principal coordinate analyses and Mantel tests indicate the presence of a significant east- west geographic gradient. Analyses of molecular variation suggest that most of the observed variation occurs within taxa, rather than among taxa. A weak inter-taxon variation is nonetheless significant for RAPD and ISSR data, and a weak pattern dependent on geographical location is evident within the province of Quebec. In accordance with studies based on morphological characters, molecular data indicate that R. rousseauiorum and R. williamsii should not be con- sidered as species distinct from R. blanda. Resume : Rosa rousseauiorum Boivin et Rosa williamsii Fern. sont deux rosiers rares, indigenes a l'est du Quebec dont le statut taxonomique est controverse. Ils sont affilies au Rosa blanda Ait. s.l. chez lequel un grand polymor- phisme morphologique est observe. Une etude moleculaire qui vise a verifier le statut taxonomique de ces deux taxons, ainsi que le statut de Rosa subblanda Rydb. et Rosa johannensis Fern., deux autres especes segregees de R. blanda s.l., a ete realisee. Nous presentons des analyses de marqueurs RAPD, ISSR et AFLP sur 86 individus provenant de 36 populations de l'est de l'Amerique du Nord. Malgre un haut taux de polymorphisme intraspecifique, les analyses de groupement et d'ordination en espace reduit ne demontrent aucun regroupement correspondant aux especes traditionnel- lement definies a l'interieur de R. blanda s.l. Neanmoins, Rosa palustris Marsh., une espece proche-parente servant de groupe temoin, est clairement distincte de R. blanda s.l. Lorsque des populations de l'ouest de l'aire de repartition de R. blanda sont incluses, un gradient est-ouest est observe et appuye par l'ordination en espace reduit et des tests de Mantel. Les analyses de variance moleculaire suggerent que la majorite de la variabilite genetique observee se trouve a l'interieur des taxa plutot qu'entre taxa. La faible variabilite inter-taxon est neanmoins significative pour les RAPD et les ISSR et un patron geographique faible regroupant les populations d'une meme region est aussi observable au Que- bec. Rosa rousseauiorum et R. williamsii, difficilement differencies a l'aide des caracteres morphologiques, ne peuvent par les analyses moleculaires etre distingues ni entre elles ni des autres especes du complexe du R. blanda au Quebec.

https://doi.org/10.1093/jme%2Ftjaa020,"Mosquito Species Composition and Abundance in Quebec, Eastern Canada","Abstract Given current and projected changes in the climate, the composition of mosquito species is predicted to shift geographically with implications for the transmission dynamics of vector-borne pathogens. Many mosquito species are rarely collected in Canada and their history is poorly understood; thus assessing their potential role as vectors for pathogenesis is difficult. Mosquitoes were collected from four trapping sites in Quebec Province, Canada, from June to September during 2018 and 2019 using BG sentinel traps. From all morphologically identified female mosquitoes, at least one specimen was selected for identification confirmation using the DNA-barcoding technique. Sequences were subjected to alignment and a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree was created using Geneious software. In total, 2,752 female mosquitoes belonging to 20 species over five genera: including Aedes (Ae.), Anopheles (An.), Culex (Cx.), Culiseta (Cu.), Coquillettidia (Cq.) were collected. The predominant mosquito was found to be Ae. cinereus. The highest number of mosquito species was captured in July, followed by August, September, and then June. Five genera were characterized by a distinctive set of cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences that formed well-supported clusters in the NJ-tree. The presence of Ae. japonicus in Quebec provides an initial look at the distribution of mosquito species in eastern Canada, which may put Canadians at risk of a wider range of arboviruses.",,,confirmation - ResponseLevel; Culiseta; DNA End-Joining Repair; Projections and Predictions; Culicidae; CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE; Aedes <genus>; Coquillettidia,,13/2/2020,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal of Medical Entomology,2020,,

Classification results from RAPD species‚Äêspecific markers and from a discriminant function based on morphology were compared. Molecular analysis of the allopatric populations indicated a small amount of interspecific gene leakage with no asymmetric directionality to introgression. A high occurrence of hybrid/introgressant individuals was observed within sympatric populations, suggesting weak reproductive isolation. As expected, the detection of such individuals was more efficient using molecular markers than with morphological traits. The hybrid zone appeared extensive with variable species structure and, in some stands, the main component composed of hybrid/introgressant trees.

Nestedness of species assemblages is frequent and may result from selective extinction or frequent colonization in insular habitats. It may also be created by a nested distribution of habitats among islands or by sampling bias. We sampled 67 isolated peatlands (7‚Äì843‚Äâha) in southern Quebec, Canada, to measure nestedness of bird species assemblages among peatlands and assess the habitat nestedness hypothesis. Species and microhabitat assemblages were both strongly nested among peatlands. Whether sites were ranked by species richness, microhabitat richness or peatland area had no effect on nestedness. However, microhabitat nestedness was significantly reduced when sites were sorted by area rather than by microhabitat richness. As expected, if bird-microhabitat associations are responsible for the nested pattern of distribution, we found a positive correlation between the contributions of bird species and microhabitats to individual site nestedness. Nevertheless, microhabitat assemblages were significantly less nested than bird species assemblages, possibly because of frequent recolonization by birds or uneven sampling among sites.",,,Mental association; Aves,,1/3/1999,,7,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,site IDs,NA,geographic feature,c. 20 bird species,no,NA,<1,source publication text,no,NA,presence only,,,,Oecologia,,,temporal_duration: 1 month
,New and noteworthy records of Orthoptera from Maritime Canada,"Although Vickery and Kevan (1985) provided an exhaustive synopsis of the grasshoppers, crickets and related insects of Canada, some of which can have significant negative economic impact, reference to their distribution maps suggests that Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick in particular, have been poorly collected for these taxa. More recently, Scudder and Vickery (2010) reviewed the Orthoptera of the Maritime region, noting the need for increased monitoring of these insects to document shifting populations and distribution in response to anticipated changes in climate. They provide a list of 21 species that occur in neighbouring Maine and Quebec, some or all of which may be anticipated to occur in the Maritime Provinces, may already be present, or may be spreading in the region. Here we briefly report on six species of Orthoptera recently encountered in New Brunswick or on Prince Edward Island, several for the first time. Most collections reported here were made during surveys specific for Orthoptera, some in the course of biotic inventories now underway in several Protected Natural Areas (PNA) in New Brunswick.

Three individuals harbored bat bugs which were subsequently identified as Cimex adjunctus Barber 1939. This is the first record of this species from C. rafinesquii. In August 2013, 10 C. rafinesquii were collected from a maternity colony in Drew County in southeastern Arkansas. Four of the bats harbored bat bugs, which were identified as C. adjunctus. This is the first record of this bat bug from Arkansas. A summary of previous state and host records of the insect is provided, as is a summary of parasite records from C. rafinesquii. Results and Discussion Rafinesque‚Äôs big eared bat (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) roosts in abandoned buildings, caves, hollow trees, and under bridges across the southeastern United States (Jones 1977, Trousdale and Beckett 2004). This bat commonly forms colonies ranging in number from a few individuals to 100 or more. On 28 June 2009, 14 C. rafinesquii were handcollected from an abandoned house near Shepherd, San Jacinto County, Texas. A maternity colony of C. rafinesquii numbering >50 individuals occupied this roost each year from 2005-2009 and in 2012 (surveys were not conducted in other years). Three Cimex adjunctus Barber 1939 were found on the torso and uropatagium of 3 lactating adult female bats. No external parasites were noted on 8 additional adult females or 3 juvenile males also captured at the same location and time. Bat bugs were preserved in ethanol and deposited in the Gibson Entomarium in the Biology Department at Stephen F. Austin State University. This is the first record of C. adjunctus from Rafinesque‚Äôs big-eared bat. A maternity colony of over 100 individuals of C. rafinesquii roosts in the Taylor House, an abandoned antebellum building located at the edge of an agricultural field adjacent to Bayou Bartholomew in Drew County, Arkansas. On August 2, 2013, 10 individuals were captured with a hand net. All of the captured bats were females; 3 were lactating. Four of the bats harbored bat bugs, which were collected and preserved in 95% ethanol. All bats were released unharmed at the point of capture. The preserved bat bugs were sent to the Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology at Auburn University, Alabama, where they were identified as Cimex adjunctus. Specimens were deposited in the insect collection of the Museum of Natural History at Auburn. This represents the first record of C. adjunctus from Arkansas. Cimex adjunctus is found over most of the eastern United States and southeastern Canada and has been recorded as far west as Colorado (Usinger 1966). It has previously been reported from Eptesicus fuscus in Illinois, Indiana (Webster and Whitaker 2005), Missouri (Bowles et al. 2013), Kansas (Sparks et al. 2003), Michigan (Dood and Kurta 1982), Alabama (Durden et al. 1992), Kentucky, Colorado, Georgia, and Florida (Usinger 1966), from Lasionycteris noctivagans in Nebraska (Usinger 1966) and South Dakota (Swier 2003), and from Nycticeus humeralis in Kansas (Sparks et al. 2003), Missouri (Bowles et al. 2013), Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Alabama, Florida, and Texas (Usinger 1966).

https://doi.org/10.5751/ace-01979-160226,No common pesticides detected in snow buntings utilizing a farmland landscape in eastern Qu√©bec,"Many species of migratory birds are declining worldwide, including throughout North America. Some of the most cited causes of decline are linked to climate change, urbanization, and growth in agriculture. Across eastern Canada, a number of insecticides and herbicides are commonly sprayed before and during the grain growing season to control pests and foliage competitors. During wintering and migration, a declining Arctic-breeding songbird, the snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis), utilizes open farmlands of southern Canada; therefore, this could be a period when the species is most exposed to these pesticides. We tested snow bunting tissues (blood and liver) for the 4 pesticides most commonly used in grain agriculture in Canada: atrazine, chlothianidin, imidacloprid, and glyphosate, as well as a glyphosate derivative (aminomethylphosphic acid, AMPA). Although this species is thought to forage in grain fields during autumn through spring, we found no detectable traces of any of the five substances. Wintering buntings may either not be exposed to these pesticides during their presence in agriculture fields or, given the rapid turnover of these pesticides in the blood and tissues, be exposed to doses below detection level in samples.

To date, approximately 50 species of Pityophthorus have been recorded in Canada, and these species are associated mainly with coniferous trees. Since 1981, no comprehensive study on this difficult taxonomic group has been conducted in Quebec, Canada, most likely due to their limited significance as forest pests. Based on data gathered from five years of field sampling in conifer seed orchards and compiled from various entomological collections, the distribution of Pityophthorus species in Quebec is presented. Approximately 291 new localities were recorded for the Pityophthorus species. Five species-group taxa, namely Pityophthorus puberulus (LeConte, 1868), Pityophthorus pulchellus pulchellus Eichhoff, 1869, Pityophthorus pulicarius (Zimmermann, 1868), Pityophthorus nitidus Swaine, 1917,and Pityophthorus cariniceps LeConte&Horn, 1876 were the most widespread. In contrast, Pityophthorus consimilis LeConte, 1878, Pityophthorus intextus Swaine, 1917, Pityophthorus dentifrons Blackman, 1922, Pityophthorus ramiperda Swaine, 1917, and Pityophthorus concavus Blackman, 1928 display a notably limited distribution. In addition, the first distribution records of Pityophthorus intextus and Pityophthorus biovalis Blackman, 1922 are furnished, and the subspecies Pityophthorus murrayanae murrayanae Blackman, 1922is reported from Quebec for the second time. Moreover, distribution maps are provided for all Pityophthorus species recorded in the province of Quebec.",,,Collections (publication); Penstemon nitidus; Weevils; Records; Diethylstilbestrol; Pityophthorus sp.

However, little is known about its offsite impacts on plant communities. We assessed the frequency and the abundance of five common boreal understorey plant species (Coptis trifolia (L.) Salisb., Cornus canadensis L., Linnaea borealis L., Lysimachia borealis (Raf.) U.Manns & Anderb., and Maianthemum canadense Desf.) at different distances around six mines in Abitibi-T√©miscamingue and Nord-du-Qu√©bec (Qu√©bec). Frequency and (or) abundance of Coptis trifolia and M. canadense decreased near mines, suggesting that they might be sensitive to the loss of forest cover, particle deposition, and soil contamination induced by mining. Conversely, the frequency and abundance of Cornus canadensis increased near active mines, which indicates its resilience to the stress caused by mines and its ability to exploit the niche space left by more sensitive species. No effects on Linnaea borealis and Lysimachia borealis were observed. Our study suggests the possible presence of offsite impacts of mines on plant communities. Further studies considering enigmatic impacts should be conducted in order to develop our understanding of the broader environmental footprint of mining activity.",,,,,28/4/2021,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Botany,2021,,

The study was conducted by sampling abundance and position of the eggs of these predators in corn monocultures in two locations of southern Quebec. The results indicated that the chrysopid Chrysopa occulata Say laid its eggs on corn leaves usually without aphid colonies, and late in the season. All other predators reacted to aphid concentrations. The syrphid Sphaerophoria philanthus (Mg.) oviposited close to the ground, early in the season, and among colonies of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi (L.). The two coccinellids laid their eggs during July and August with a maximum during tasseling for Coleomegilla maculata lengi (Timberlake) and after pollination for Hippodamia tredecimpunctata tibialis Say. Of these two species, the latter one selected sites at higher levels on the plant, and was more abundant at the edges of the field. It is suggested that the observed niche partitioning cannot be the result of interspecific competition in variable environments such as maize monocultures. R√©sum√© L‚Äôanalyse en composantes principales est utilis√©e afin de mettre en √©vidence la r√©partition de niches de quatre aphidiphages en utilisant leur strat√©gie de ponte.

Paleobiology of Climactichnites, an Enigmatic Late Cambrian Fossil. Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology, number 74, 74 pages, frontispiece, 58 figures, 1993.‚ÄîClimactichnites wilsoni Logan, 1860, is redescribed from field investigations and specimens in various museums. Climactichnites youngi Todd, 1882, and C. fosteri Todd, 1882, are placed in synonymy. The species is known only from its trail, consisting of raised bars and impressed furrows, bounded by two parallel, raised lateral ridges. This structure is interpreted as being formed from damp sand, redistributed and molded by the animal. At a few localities, an oval impression occurs at the origin of the trail; a new locality for this rare feature was found in Wisconsin. In Quebec a trail crossing over itself was found; this phenomenon was known from only one other locality. All occurrences of Climactichnites are in the Late Cambrian; specimens are known from New York, Quebec, Ontario, Wisconsin, and Missouri. This fossil is probably confined to the Dresbachian, the earliest stage of the tri-part Late Cambrian. All examples of trails are in sandstones; these are interpreted as sand flats that were just above water during low tide in the shallow epicontinental sea. A variety of animals have been proposed as the trail maker; they include several different kinds of arthropods, mollusks, and ""worms."" Each proposal has weak points and none of the suggested animal groups has appropriate morphology to produce the marking. The animal is reconstructed as relatively low, broad, and about twice as long as wide. It is hypothesized that the tough body integument secreted mucus which facilitated movement and aided in preservation of the trail. A large flap covered most of the outside body and extended laterally over the muscular foot. Free edges of the flap on either side of the body compressed and molded damp sand into parallel bounding ridges. Respiratory organs may have been present below the flap edges, kept moist by being partially enclosed. By moving the edges of these lateral flaps, the organism may have been able to swim when in water. Most trails of Climactichnites are interpreted as a consequence of feeding activity. If so, food was taken in through a circular mouth located anteriorward on the ventral surface; this morphologic feature is inferred from circular markings seen on a few bars. As reconstructed, the sand under the animal was compressed anteriorly and laterally; the animal then brushed particles forward into a small dune-like bar, probably by the action of cilia on its ventral surface. Sand dwelling microorganisms displaced by brushing were concentrated centrally, obviating ingestion of large amounts of sediment. What sediment was taken in was released at irregular intervals through a posterior anus; medial marking on parts of some trails are interpreted as fecal strings. The complex clamping and brushing behavior, implies a well-developed nervous system. No body fossils are known in the Vendian or in the Paleozoic that could have constructed this form of trail. The proposed method of feeding, if correctly interpreted, is unique. Thus the trail of Climactichnites may constitute the work of an otherwise unknown phylum in the animal kingdom.

,Pannaria lurida in Atlantic Canada,"Apart from several unconfirmed reports of Pannaria lurida (Mont.) Nyl. in Quebec (Lepage, 1947, 1958; to be discussed below) and a very doubtful o ne from Newfoundland or labrador (Eckfeldt 1895, as Physma luridum Mont.), noth ing is known about the occurrence of this interesting but often overlooked species in Ca nada. Pannaria lurida belongs to the P. rubiginosa group (J0rgensen 1978) and is distinguished from the most closely related species, P. rubiginosa (Ach.) Bory, by its larger, conspicuously wrinkled and often greyish green thallus lobes (Fig 1A & B). The more greyish coloration is caused by the pronounced accumulation o f pannarin, a chlori nated depsidone which is produced in lesser amounts in P. rubiginosa and its sorediate counterpart P. conoplea (Ach.) Bory. The algal symbiont is Nostoc as is usual with members of Pannariaceae. Specimens in the Smithsonian Institution (US) and the Farlow Herbarium (FH) i ndicate that P. lurida had been collected at least as far north as Maine (South Thomaston and Warren in Knox County and Salisbury Cove in Hancock County). The species seems to be restricted to the eastern seaboard of northern North America, the so utheastern U.S.A. (Hale 1979) and some mountains in the Caribbean, altho ugh so me misidentified specimens of Pannaria from the Hawaiian Islands have been seen under this name (GB, Goteborg). During our surveys of forest lichens in eastern Canada and the adjacent parts of Maine we have noted the presence of P. lurida in southern Nova Scotia and less frequently along the Northumberland Straits and in eastern Maine (Fig 2). These areas are more or less strongly influenced by an oceanic el i mate and lie outside or along the edge of the boreal coniferous zone. The habitats are mostly very wet mixed forests in which Fraxinus americana l., F. nigra Marsh. and Acer rubrum L. are dominant. Pannaria lurida is a rare member of the lobarion. It often grows together with related species of Pannaria, most often P. rubiginosa and P. conoplea but also P. ahlneri P. M. ]0rg. and P. leucosticta (Tuck. in Darl .) Nyl. (in southern Nova Scotia). By cont rast to these species, all of which are able to grow on coniferous bark, especiall y on that of Thuja, P. lurida has been fo und only on deciduo us trees. We have seen the lichen on the fo llowing phorophytes (number of observations in parentheses): A cer rubrum (8), A. saccharum Marsh. (1), fagus grandifolia Ehrh .

Both species are common, semiaquatic bugs (Hemiptera; Gerridae) found on the surface of streams and small rivers. Allozyme studies have shown them to be more distantly related than most other congeneric species in the Gerridae, with significant barriers to gene flow where their ranges abut. We assess postmating reproductive isolation between A. remigoides and A. remigis, using a bracket cross design with five sampling sites along a north‚Äìsouth cline traversing the hybrid zone. We also report the results of long-distance conspecific crosses of A. remigis, using populations from California and Quebec. Neither these nor the intraspecific bracket crosses reveal any evidence of isolation by distance within species. However, heterospecific crosses show significantly reduced fertility, hatching success, survival of both sexes to eclosion (final moult) and percentage of males. Egg production is not influenced by cross type, and we found no evidence of hybrid sterility in either sex. Analyses of genotypic frequencies at three isozyme loci in eight hybrid and 22 pure populations reveal significant deficiencies of heterozygotes in hybrid populations. The proportion of males is also significantly lower in hybrid populations than in pure populations. The laboratory and field results indicate that postmating isolation between these two species occurs in the form of severe reductions in both the fertility of heterospecific crosses and the viability of hybrids, particularly hybrid males. Genetic mechanisms for Haldane's rule and asymmetries in the reciprocal heterospecific crosses are discussed.",,,Heterozygote; Fertility; Two-Hybrid System Techniques; Genotype; Hemiptera; Infertility; Reproduction; Hybrids; Reproductive Isolation; Gerridae; hatching; Isoenzymes; Gene Flow,,1/6/1997,,8,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"New Brunswick, Maine"

Glossy buckthorn has impacts on the biodiversity and productivity of invaded forests. Currently, we do not know much about the species‚Äô ecology and no thorough study of its distribution in temperate forests has been performed yet. As is often the case with invasive plant species, the phenology of glossy buckthorn differs from that of other indigenous plant species found in invaded communities. In the forests of eastern Canada, the main phenological difference is a delay in the shedding of glossy buckthorn leaves, which occurs later in the fall than for other indigenous tree species found in that region. Therefore, our objective was to use that phenological characteristic to map the spatial distribution of glossy buckthorn over a portion of southern Qu√©bec, Canada, using remote sensing-based approaches. We achieved this by applying a linear temporal unmixing model to a time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images to create a map of the probability of the occurrence of glossy buckthorn for the study area. The map resulting from the temporal unmixing model shows an agreement of 69% with field estimates of glossy buckthorn occurrence measured in 121 plots distributed over the study area. Glossy buckthorn mapping accuracy was limited by evergreen species and by the spectral and spatial resolution of the Landsat 8 OLI.",,,Multispectral image; Time series,,13/3/2020,,1,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,Frangula alnus,,,,,,,,,,,Remote Sensing,2020,,

A source of recent heated debate has been how such global changes, including land transformation, affect species richness and ecosystem functioning. Growing scientific consensus suggests that more diverse communities support greater ecosystem functioning; however, species numbers might fluctuate over time, and ecosystem processes are shaped by both species richness and species identities. In recent decades, habitat loss and major biodiversity change has occurred on the edge of urban centres because of land transformation to suburban development. Biological surveys provide a valuable record of how biodiversity has responded to this habitat transformation, especially if they have been conducted in the same location over time. Here, we examine changes in species richness, composition and phylogenetic structure between two surveys of vascular plants conducted over 50¬†years apart on Mont St. Hilaire, Qu√©bec, Canada‚Äîa UNESCO Biosphere Reserve surrounded by residential development. We found 198 more species in the more recent survey, but failed to detect 70 species that had been recorded in the earlier survey. A significant number of species gains were closely-related introduced non-native species. Species found only during the first survey (species losses) were frequently native species of special conservation status, and these species tended to be more evolutionarily distinct than species gained. Our results demonstrate that, in a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, there have been significant changes in species richness and composition over the last half-century that might have far-reaching effects on ecosystem properties.",,,Tracheobionta; Phylogenetics; Global change; Community; Ecosystem; Sensorineural Hearing Loss (disorder); Gain; Sense of identity (observable entity); Biosphere; UNESCO,,1/3/2019,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,Biodiversity and Conservation,2019,,

The primary reservoir host of the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, is the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), whose range is rapidly shifting north into southern Qu√©bec. The deer mouse, P. maniculatus, is occurring over most Qu√©bec province and is a less competent host for B. burgdorferi. Here, we compared the phylogeographic structure of both Peromyscus species in Qu√©bec. Using a combination of multiple mitochondrial DNA markers and phylogeographic methods, we detected an ongoing and rapid expansion of P. leucopus, while P. maniculatus appears more stable. Haplotype and populations networks indicated that populations of P. maniculatus exhibit more genetic structure than P. leucopus across the study area. Furthermore, significant and consistent genetic divergences between populations of the two species on both sides of the St. Lawrence River suggest that distinct lineages of P. leucopus and P. maniculatus with different ancestral origins colonized Southern Qu√©bec following the Last Glacial Maximum. The phylogeographic structure of pathogens is expected to mirror the structure observed in their reservoir hosts. As different strains of Borrelia burgdorferi may be associated with different levels of pathogenicity and immune responses of their hosts, our results are helpful at better understanding the pattern of spread of Lyme disease in a zone of emergence, and associated risk for human populations.",,,Haplotypes; Reservoir Device Component; Lyme Disease; National origin; Peromyscus; Immune response,,3/12/2015,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,site coordinates,NA,no,"Peromyscus leucopus, Peromyscus maniculatus",2011,source publication text,1,NA,40000,NA,presence-absence,,,,Biodiversity and Conservation,,,

Debarking damage by voles was not concentrated on specific coniferous species but occurred rather in meadows where Fragaria was relatively more abundant.

We present a time-efficient method to estimate the relative reproductive activity of the forest songbird community. A recording of mobbing calls of Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) was broadcast at pre-selected stations during the breeding season. These calls attracted individuals of many bird species present in the vicinity, allowing visual detection of reproductive activity (e.g., adults carrying food or presumed pairs). In mature deciduous forests of northern New Brunswick, 50 bird species responded to the playbacks. Playbacks significantly increased the probability of visual observations of birds compared to silent observations conducted before broadcasting mobbing calls. In coniferous forests of central Qu√©bec, playbacks attracted 24 species and also provided a significantly greater opportunity to make visual observations of individual birds. In New Brunswick, mobbing playbacks facilitated more observations of reproductive evidence relative to point counts. Observation periods were brief and a 306-ha plot (1.75 √ó 1.75 km, 64 points spaced 250 m apart) could be surveyed by foot in less than 32 observer-hours. The proportion of individuals of a given species showing evidence of reproductive activity was used as an index of reproductive success.

,"Population , reproductive success , ' and analysis of contaminants in Razorbills ( Alea torda ) in the estuary and Gulf of St . Lawrence , Quebec by","Introduction The seabird survey program in the sanctuaries on the North Shore of the Gulf of St Lawrence has enabled us to follow the fluctuations in population of several species from 1925 to 1977 (Chapdelaine 1980). Alcidae and Laridae are the principal families surveyed, representing 56070 and 37% respectively of the total. Among the Alcidae, Razorbills (Alea torda) and Puffins (Fratereula aretiea) in particular have decreased in numbers sin ce 1965. ln this project, we dealt with Razorbills because of their large numbers in the estuary and Gulf of St Lawrence. B√©dard (1969) estimated the Razorbill population of Canada to be 42 200, with 50""70 occurring in the estuary and gulf. More recently, Nettleship (1977) estimated this population at 38 130 birds. On the basis of this revised figure and the most recent data (Table 1), the number of Razorbills in the estuary and gulf would represent no more than 18% of the total in the western Atlantic. The purpose of this project is to update the information on the distribution and abundance of Razorbills in the estuary and Gulf of St Lawrence and to present sorne biological parameters on reproduction and the presence of contaminants in eggs.

To assess the effects of site type, forest initiation periods and fire regimes on the dynamics of Pinus banksiana (Jack pine), the age structure of 69 populations of the species was analyzed. Two landscapes with different fire regimes were selected in the southern part of the Canadian boreal forest in Quebec: the ‚Äòmainland landscape‚Äô is characterized by a fire regime of large lethal fires, the ‚Äòisland landscape‚Äô is affected by a complex fire regime including lethal and non-lethal fires. Age structure was compared between forest initiation periods and site types (mesic mainland, xeric mainland and xeric island) using the Shannon regularity index. An even-aged population structure was found within the first 100 yr following a lethal fire, while after that period the population structure becomes more uneven-aged. Under mesic conditions, populations tend to have an even-aged structure, under xeric conditions an uneven-aged structure. Natural openings present in xeric sites allow for recruitment in the absence of fire. This permits the self-maintenance of Pinus banksiana. Xeric island populations show more uneven-aged structures than xeric mainland populations. The occurrence of non-lethal fires on the islands creates uneven-aged structures. Further, the results suggest that the selection pressure of the island fire regime, favouring non-serotinous and mixed P. banksiana individuals, is one of the factors responsible for a higher recruitment in the absence of fire on islands than on the mainland.",,,,,1/12/1993,,5,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,appendix,article,no,NA,site coordinates,Pinus banksiana,no,NA,no,NA,no,NA,abundance,,,,Journal of Vegetation Science,,,58 populations of Pinus banksiana.

In general, mean abundance of Diplostomumspp. in the lens of spottail shiners was highest at sites near large ring-billed gull ( Larus delawarensis ) colonies and was higher in 1998 than in 1997. Population studies demonstrated a major period of recruitment in the late summer ‚Äì early autumn. Mean abundance increased between November and May, when sampling was logistically not possible, reflecting latefall or early-spring recruitment. Golden shiners ( Notemigonus crysoleucas ) and small yellow perch ( Perca flavescens ) were monitored at a single site (√éle aux Ours) in 1997 and 1998. Mean abundance of Diplostomumspp. in the lens of golden shiners at √éle aux Ours was higher in 1998 than in 1997. Recruitment occurred in the early summer and be tween November and May, suggesting late-fall or early-spring transmission. Mean abundance decreased between Au gust and October in both years. Yellow perch at √éle aux Ours were infected with four different parasite species in their eyes. Mean abundance of Diplostomumspp. in the vitreous humour or retina increased during the summer and fall and then decreased between the fall and following spring. Diplostomumspp. in the lens increased in abundance in the early summer, and then decreased during the fall. Both Tylodelphys scheuringi and Neascusspp. in the vitreous humour were more abundant in 0+ than in 1+ perch. Mean abundance of T. scheuringiincreased over the summer in 1997 and then dropped to zero in the same cohort over winter, suggesting that the parasite lives for only 1 year. Neascusspp. only were found in 1998. Distributional data, together with seasonal information, suggest that habitat characteristics contribute significantly to the abundance of Diplostomumspp. along the St. Lawrence River. Proximity to gull colonies enhances abundance, but higher rates of predation at wetland sites depress abundance and restrict the accumulation of parasites. 1113 R√©sum√©: L‚Äôinfection par la douve de l‚Äôoeil chez le Queue √† tache noire ( Notropis hudsonius ) a fait l‚Äôobjet d‚Äôun suivi mensuel du printemps √† l‚Äôautomne 1997 et 1998, √† quatre sites du fleuve Saint-Laurent, Qu√©bec.

We found that contemporary populations of the two species are distinct in morphology and interpret this differentiation as a reflection of resource partitioning, a mechanism favouring their local coexistence. While there was no size trend, geographic or temporal, both species displayed a concomitant change in the shape of their skull over the last 50¬†years, although this change was much more apparent in the white-footed mouse. As a result, the two species diverged over time and became more distinct in their morphology. The observed changes in morphology are large given the short time scale. During this period, there was also a shift in abundance of the two species in Southern Quebec, consistent with the northern displacement of the range of the white-footed mouse in the last 15¬†years. Our study thus reports the changes in morphology of two co-occurring mammal species that were accompanied by changes in distribution and local abundance, potentially in response to rapid climate change.",,,Displacement mapping; Manuscripts; Ecology; Coexist (image); Galaxy morphological classification; Genus; Population; Multitier architecture; Specimen Collection; Biological specimen; Mathematical morphology; Peromyscus; RL (complexity); Interaction,,2/8/2017,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,"article, appendix",".xlsx, article","site coordinates, site IDs, administrative unit",NA,Map,"Peromyscus maniculatus, Peromyscus leucopus",1959-2011,source publication text,46,source publication text,17000,no,abundance,,,,Evolutionary Ecology,,,12 years total

In the 25¬†years following the initial 1967 report of the disease, butternut canker was able to quickly spread throughout the entire range of butternut (Juglans cinerea) in North America, from Minnesota in the upper Midwest to Tennessee in the south and Quebec in the north-east. The speed of this dispersal is notable as butternut trees do not make up a significant proportion of any single forest type. Instead, they are usually found sparingly in most mixed hardwood forests. In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge of the invasion process of the butternut canker pathogen, Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum, an invasive fungal pathogen, that as its emergence has spread across North America and is now found wherever butternut naturally occurs. Taxonomic studies have determined that the fungus belongs in the genus Ophiognomonia, which includes a number of saprophytes, endophytes and pathogens of members of the Fagales, rather than the genus Sirococcus, which includes several important pine pathogens. The ability of fungus to be dispersed by rain splash, transported on and in beetle vectors, transmitted by infected seed and successfully colonized several species of Juglans and Carya have all likely contributed to the rapid increase in abundance and severity of disease and tree mortality in the invaded forest ecosystems. Recent genomic and population genetic analyses have determined that there were at least three emergence events. A less virulent strain of the fungus likely has been present in the north eastern United States for over a century, but it was the emergence of a more virulent strain of the fungus in Minnesota and Wisconsin in the 1960s that resulted in range-wide mortality and pushed butternut to be listed as an endangered species in Canada and a number of states in the United States.",,,,,1/2/2015,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,Map,Ophiognomonia clavigignenti-juglandacearum,,,,,,,,,,,Forest Pathology,2014,,
https://doi.org/10.1093/SYSBIO%2F35.1.68,Reconstructing biogeographic history using phylogenetic-tree analysis of community structure,"The dispersal of a community in a territory can be reconstructed using various more or less specific methods of data analysis. When the data are in the form of presence/ absence of species for the various units of territory, or in the form of frequencies of occurrence, they are analogous to the data used for reconstructing evolutionary trees. Furthermore, when one is looking for a treelike structure of dispersal, issued from a common trunk, the tree- reconstruction methods may represent an appropriate analytical tool. Four tree-reconstruction methods are found to be appropriate in their hypotheses. They lead to satisfactory trees when applied to a data set describing the geographic distribution of the stenohaline freshwater fishes of the Quebec peninsula, previously divided into 21 regions. For binary data, the method of Camin and Sokal and the polymorphism parsimony method were used with success, while the continuous character data maximum-likelihood method and the least-squares method of Cavalli- Sforza and Edwards were applied to frequency-of-occurrence data. When compared to a method of pairwise comparison of adjacent regions, it is shown that the tree-reconstruction methods provide the user with information that is not found otherwise. I also show that external infor- mation (i.e., geographic adjacencies, and the degree of asymmetry of the faunal vectors of regions connected by the tree), available in biogeographic data but not taken into account by the tree-reconstruction algorithms, must be considered to render the results meaningful.

The Extended R-Value (ERV) model was used to obtain relative pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) for eight tree taxa and to determine the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) for lakes in this ecosystem. Modern vegetation was estimated using pollen data from 16 small (<0.5 km2) lakes and a species-level vegetation survey of southern Quebec. The RSAP was estimated to be within 1600 m of the lakes. Tsuga, Fagus, and Quercus were the most productive taxa, and Populus and Acer were the lowest. Reconstructed changes in absolute vegetation cover show a high abundance of Picea followed by Populus in the early Holocene.

Ecologists have developed methods to select which habitats should be conserved. The Ecological value, a method based on vegetation, has been created for the urban habitats of Montreal (Quebec, Canada). The main objective of our study was to determine if this method was relevant to assess carabid diversity of Mount Royal Park. This index is calculated using five criteria: uniqueness, representativeness, degree of succession, richness and rarity of the flora, each of which can influence communities of insects. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were selected because of their success as biological indicators. Despite sampling difficulties, our results demonstrate clearly that the Ecological value method does not represent the high carabid richness of urban open habitats (tall grasses) and their specialised native carabid species. Within forests we found nonetheless that the ecological value index has a significant positive relationship with native carabid abundance. Moreover, maturity and structure of urban forests were positively correlated with carabid abundance and richness. Some urban vegetation characteristics have been shown to influence entomological diversity, but the relevance of using a global floral index to encompass the carabid community seems limited.",,,Sampling (signal processing); Forests; Succession; Order Coleoptera; Community; Poaceae; Ground state; Habitat; Relevance; Insecta; Capability Maturity Model,,1/8/2009,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,site IDs,NA,site coordinates,c 36 Carabid species,2002-2003,source publication text,1,NA,0.5,no,abundance,,,,Journal of Insect Conservation,,,
https://doi.org/10.1039/b912185d,Responses of two sentinel species (Hexagenia limbata--mayfly; Pyganodon grandis--bivalve) along spatial cadmium gradients in lakes and rivers in northwestern Qu√©bec.,"Specimens of the mayfly larva Hexagenia limbata and of the floater mussel Pyganodon grandis were sampled in rivers and lakes contaminated by trace metals in the Abitibi-James Bay region in northwestern Qu√©bec. Water samples were collected at each sampling site with in situ diffusion samplers and analyzed for major cations, anions and trace metals (Cd, Cu, Mn, Zn). Surficial sediment samples were also collected at each site and analyzed for Cd, Cu and Zn. In response to Cd contamination at river and lake sites, both sentinel organisms accumulated the metal and synthesized metallothionein (MT), a metal-binding protein synthesized by organisms as a defence mechanism against excess metals in the surrounding media. At the river sites, H. limbata unexpectedly maintained much higher concentrations of MT per unit of accumulated Cd than at the lake sites; this difference between lentic and lotic environments may reflect the response of the species to the more stressful hydrodynamic conditions that prevail in a river. The accumulation of Cd in the mayflies at lake and river sites decreased as a function of the ambient manganese concentration. We hypothesize that dissolved Mn protects against Cd bioaccumulation in H. limbata. The present results support the contention that one cannot extrapolate conclusions drawn from the use of a single sentinel species to a larger set of freshwater invertebrates--both the mayfly and the bivalve are promising biomonitors.",,,Collections (publication); Metallothionein; Manuscripts; negative regulation of reactive oxygen species biosynthetic process; Hydrodynamics; Natural Science Disciplines; Copper; Large; Cations; Class Bivalvia; Anions; Invertebrates; Manganese; Swyer-James Syndrome; Metals; Ephemeroptera; 11-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid; Acclimatization; Larva; Cadmium; Sentinel Species,,15/1/2010,,7,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,article,article,"site coordinates, geographic feature",NA,Map,"Hexagenia limbata, Pyganodon grandis","1994-1997, 2000-2001",source publication text,4,no,6400,no,presence-only,,,,Journal of Environmental Monitoring,,,

This phenomenon could be inhibited by large herbivores through selective browsing that reduces shrub growth. Our objective was to assess the dynamics of shrub species in the Deception Bay area, in Nunavik (Qu√©bec, Canada), a region in the summer range of the Rivi√®re-aux-Feuilles migratory caribou herd. We surveyed abundance and stem mortality of all shrub species along systematically located transects in a 54¬†km2 area. Our results showed that shrubs covered 11.5% of the area, and were dominated by prostrate Betula glandulosa (8.7%). Stem mortality of established individuals was greater for Salix planifolia (45.6%) and Salix glauca (46.5%) than for B. glandulosa (9.3%). Using dendrochronological analysis, we determined the age structure of the two dominant erect shrub species in ten 10¬†m¬†√ó¬†10¬†m plots. We recorded a high number of B. glandulosa and, to a lesser extent, of S. planifolia recruits (71.0 and 4.6 per 100¬†m2, respectively) established after 1999, when the Rivi√®re-aux-Feuilles herd was abundant. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis that large herbivores counteracted the positive effects of climate change on shrub recruitment. However, since the structure of the recruits are prostrate rather than erect, as is usually observed with shrub expansion in the warming Arctic, it is likely that herbivory, and/or, the harsh climate, is constraining habitat change.",,,Manuscripts; Mike Lesser; Field research; Herbivory; Large; Image resolution; Square Kilometer; Natural Science Disciplines; Tree accumulation; Reindeer; Diethylstilbestrol; Linear algebra; standards characteristics; Willow,,9/5/2018,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,"Betula glandulosa, Salix planifolia",,,,,,,,,,,Polar Biology,2018,,

,"Scientific literature on the origins of Didymo , felt soled wading boots , and vectors for some aquatic invasive species","We outline, in chronological sequence, the events and findings over 25 years that have shaped our understanding of Didymosphenia geminate (Lyngbye) M. Schmidt blooms. Starting with the first appearance of D. geminata mats in streams on Vancouver Island in the late 1980s and followed years later by blooms in Iceland, South Dakota and Poland, D. geminata blooms were enigmatic for nearly 20 years. Early papers exploring whether blooms were caused by environmental change consistently failed to identify any specific factor(s) associated with their onset. Following the D. geminata outbreak in New Zealand in 2004 that seemed to result from an introduction of the species, the possibility that blooms that had previously occurred elsewhere in the world might also be explained by the introduction and movement among watersheds of a new variant with a bloom-forming tendency was touted and widely accepted. Now, however, the identification of very low soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP; below ‚àº2 ppb) as the proximate cause of bloom formation, has led to the more likely explanation that D. geminata blooms are the result of large-scale human intervention in climatic, atmospheric and edaphic processes that favour this ultra-oligotrophic species. In this new view, blooms of D. geminata are not simply due to the introduction of cells into new areas. Rather, bloom formation occurs when the SRP concentration is low, or is reduced to low levels by the process of oligotrophication. Mechanisms that potentially cause oligotrophication on global and regional scales are identified. Taylor, B. W; and M. L. Bothwell. 2014.

Abstract: Management authorities often perceive Didymosphenia geminata (didymo) as an invasive, nuisance diatom species that has been introduced to eastern Canada; however, observations from early 20th century diatom surveys challenge this characterization. We apply paleolimnological techniques to place recent didymo blooms from Gasp√©sie, Quebec, into historical and environmental context. Sedimentary diatom assemblages were examined from Lac Humqui (a headwater lake) and Lac au Saumon (a lake with an inflowing river currently supporting blooms). The Lac Humqui assemblage experienced a broad-scale shift in their dominant life strategy with declines in fragilarioid taxa and increases in planktonic diatoms (i.e., Cyclotella‚ÄìDiscostella species) that began_1970 and increased to modern abundances_1990. Strong relationships between this diatom shift and increases in regional air temperatures and earlier river ice-out dates are consistent with longer growing seasons and enhanced thermal stability in Lac Humqui. Didymo was observed throughout the Lac au Saumon core, demonstrating that it has been present in the region since at least _1970.

The bloom-forming freshwater stalked diatom Didymosphenia geminata is unusual among algae in that nuisance growths occur almost exclusively in oligotrophic waters. Current hypotheses to explain this phenomenon have assumed supplemental acquisition of phosphorus from novel sources within the stalk ‚ÅÑmat matrix. 2. We carried out a synoptic survey of river sites in the South Island, New Zealand, to determine whether D. geminata cell division and stalk development (measured as mat coverage or standing crop) were related to ambient phosphorus concentrations in the overlying river water. 3. High coverage (>50%) by D. geminata was largely concentrated at sites with mean dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) <2 mg m) in the overlying water. Didymosphenia geminata was present at only one site with DRP >4 mg m)3, with very low coverage. Cell division rate (measured as the frequency of dividing cells, FDC) was positively correlated with mean DRP suggesting that division rates were controlled by the available phosphorus concentration in ambient river water. At the same time, FDC was negatively correlated with D. geminata standing crop (measured as an index incorporating percentage cover and mat thickness). 4. In a single river reach with a stable cross-channel gradient of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) caused by inflows from a high-nutrient tributary, again we observed a negative correlation between percentage cover by D. geminata and concentrations of TDP. 5. Finally, we made a series of observations on D. geminata-dominated communities that had been exposed to water enriched with NO3 -N and PO4 -P for 4 weeks, followed by exposure to unenriched water. After 2 weeks of nutrient deprivation, D. geminata cell division rates declined by 60%, mean stalk length increased by 250%, and total carbohydrate quadrupled relative to initial values. The appearance of the community changed from a dark brown mat to a thick pale mat typical of D. geminata blooms. 6. All these results indicate that D. geminata cell division rates are actively controlled by concentrations of available phosphorus in the overlying water and that stalk production (represented by mat thickness and extent, stalk length and total carbohydrate) is inversely related to D. geminata cell division rates. They thus support an explanation for D. geminata blooms in oligotrophic rivers tied to enhanced stalk production in nutrient-poor waters, rather than through acquisition of additional phosphorus through recycling processes within the mat.

 We describe seasonal patterns of parasitism by Telenomus coloradensis Crawford, Telenomus droozi Muesebeck, Telenomus flavotibiae Pelletier (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae), and Trichogramma spp. (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae), egg parasitoids of the hemlock looper, Lambdina fiscellaria (Guen√©e) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), after a 3-yr survey of defoliated stands in the lower St. Lawrence region (Quebec, Canada). Results from sentinel trap sampling indicate that T. coloradensis and T. droozi are the most common species, whereas parasitism by T. flavotibiae and Trichogramma spp. is rare. Telenomus coloradensis and T. droozi show similar seasonal periods of parasitism, both species being active in early spring (late April) at temperatures as low as 4¬∞C. Using thermal threshold (T0) and thermal constant (K) for immature development of T. coloradensis males and females from egg to adult emergence, we estimated that the spring progeny emerges in the middle of the summer while hemlock looper eggs are absent from the forest environment. Parasitoid females would then mate and remain in the environment to 1) exploit alternate host species, 2) enter into quiescence and later parasitize eggs laid by hemlock looper females in the fall, 3) enter into a reproductive diapause and parasitize hemlock looper eggs only the next spring, or all of these. Although previous studies have shown that T. coloradensis can overwinter in its immature form within the host egg, our field and laboratory results indicate that in the lower St. Lawrence region, this species principally enters diapause as fertilized females, with a mean supercooling point of -30.6¬∞C in the fall.",,,Ecology; Ovum; parasitism; Reproduction; Lambdina fiscellaria nucleopolyhedrovirus; Scelionidae; Diapause; Geometridae; Hymenoptera; Lepidoptera; Tsuga,,24/12/2012,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,geographic feature,NA,site coordinates,"Telenomus spp, Hemlock Looper",2002-2005,source publication text,no,NA,0.5,source publication text,abundance,,,,Environmental Entomology,,,
https://doi.org/10.1603/EN10045,Selected Beetle Assemblages Captured in Pitfall Traps Baited with Deer Dung or Meat in Balsam Fir and Sugar Maple Forests of Central Quebec,"ABSTRACT Vertebrate dung and carrion are rich and strongly attractive resources for numerous beetles that are often closely linked to them. The presence and abundance of beetles exploiting such resources are influenced by various ecological factors including climate and forest cover vegetation. We studied selected assemblages of coprophilous and necrophagous beetles in Quebec along a 115-km north-south transect in three balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Miller) forest sites and in a fourth forest site dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall), close to the southern fir site. Beetle abundance was estimated using a sampling design comprising replicated pitfall traps baited with red deer meat or dung in each site. A total of 8,511 beetles were caught and identified to family level, 95.7% of which belonged to families with known coprophilous or necrophagous behavior. Meat-baited pitfall traps caught nearly 15 times as many beetles as dung-baited traps. All Histeridae, Hydrophilidae, Scarabaeidae, and Silphidae were identified to species to examine specific diversity variation among sites. For the beetles caught in the meat-baited traps (majority of captures), decreases in abundance and species richness were observed from south to north along the fir forest transect, with evidence of decreasing specific diversity as measured by the Shannon index of diversity. Strong differences in species assemblages were also observed between the southern maple and fir forest sites. The Silphidae and Histeridae were more abundant in the maple forest, whereas the Hydrophilidae and Ptilidae were more abundant in the fir forest.",,,Forests; Order Coleoptera; Abies; Balsams; Acer; Feces; Carrion beetle; Saccharum,,1/8/2010,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,no,NA,site coordinates,c.30 beetle species,2006,source publication text,<1,no,no,NA,abundance,,,,Environmental Entomology,,,

Surveys were conducted, 2 years before and 2 years after logging, to determine the relative abundance of 12 wildlife species, and telemetry data were also gathered on four species. Small mammals, species with the smallest home ranges (1 ha), either remained in the clearcut patches or had replacement habitat in the buffer strips. Most species with home ranges up to 25 ha (spruce grouse, Falcipennis canadensis Linne; snowshoe hare, Lepus americanus Erxleben) were excluded from clearcut patches. Species with home ranges 5 km2 (marten, Martes americana Turton; moose, Alces alces Linne) remained in some residual forest patches scattered throughout clearcuts and in the adjacent uncut forest.

The objectives of this study were to characterize the foliar predatory fauna associated with A. glycines in commercial soybean fields in Qu√©bec, Canada, and to evaluate the suitability of A. glycines as prey for three coccinellid species: Harmonia axyridis Pallas, Propylea quatuordecimpunctata L. and Coleomegilla maculata lengi Timberlake (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Field surveys showed that several predators responded rapidly to expanding and increasing populations of the soybean aphid. Coccinellidae were the most important aphidophagous predators observed in 2002 (58.6%) and 2003 (44.8%), with mainly four native and naturalized species co-occurring with the soybean aphid throughout the growing season. Measurement of fitness parameters under laboratory conditions (survival, development time, longevity, fecundity) indicated that A. glycines is an excellent prey for the development and reproduction of all three of the coccinellid species studied. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) was highest for H. axyridis (0.238¬†d‚àí1), intermediate for P. quatuordecimpunctata (0.215¬†d‚àí1) and lowest for C. maculata (0.134¬†d‚àí1).",,,Coccinellidae; Fertility; Propylea quatuordecimpunctata; Population; Soybeans; Arthropods; Harmonia <angiosperm>; Aphids; Aphis glycines; PALLAS; Prey,,1/2/2006,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,Aphis glycines,,,,,,,,,,,BioControl,2006,,

The corolla spotting and colour morphs in I. pallida each appear to be determined by different pairs of unlinked loci. Dominant alleles at each locus pair are required for the expression of corolla spotting or yellow corolla colouration. Stem waxiness in I. capensis is also shown to be under genetic control. Significant clustering of identical flower and stem phenotypes at small interplant distances was observed in most population samples, suggesting substructuring of genotypes in space. The sizes of patches where morph frequencies occurred in excess of random expectations were found to be consistent among populations and polymorphisms within the species, lending support to the interpretation that substructuring of genetic variation in these populations is due to restricted gene dispersal. The population genetical consequences of limited gene flow in these species is discussed.",,,Impatiens pallida; Spatial analysis; Variation (Genetics); Phenotype; Genotype; Genetic Polymorphism; Corolla (plant part); Autocorrelation; Offset binary; Corolla (genus); Metrorrhagia; LOCUS; Cluster analysis; Patch (computing); Population; Hemicordylus capensis; Gene Flow,,1/10/1989,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,"Impatiens pallida, Impatiens capensis",,,,,,,,,,,Heredity,1989,,

We manipulated the biodiversity of the community via combinations of Macoma balthica, Mya arenaria, and Nereis virens in sediment microcosms containing sieved and homogenized tidal-flat sediment. Each combination was adjusted to similar total biovolumes and in situ animal densities. Compared to treatments with single species, which were also adjusted to similar biovolumes and densities, combinations of multiple species changed the fluxes of oxygen, phosphate, ammonium, and nitrate across the sediment-water interface and altered the composition of the microbial community beyond the level predicted by linear addition of the single species effects. Most combinations involved positive interactions that increased net fluxes. Although N. virens dominated system behavior, we also observed positive interactions between the two bivalves, and between N. virens and M. balthica. Weaker interactions, sometimes negative, were observed between N. virens and M. arenaria. Most effects could be directly linked to total oxic sediment volumes and burrow volumes generated by the different species. N. virens had the maximum species-specific burrow volume/biovolume ratio, and its presence maximally impacted fluxes. The principal interactions between species that affect net solute fluxes reflect space occupation, life habit (position, location), and irrigation of burrows. These factors interact with reactive substrate distributions and remineralization patterns to produce particular flux balances. Future studies should include the relationships of biodiversity to spatial scales over which the functional groups are distributed, the volumes actively occupied and irrigated, production rates of burrows, and the depths to which the organisms burrow. 1.

https://doi.org/10.1139/B05-025,Spontaneous revegetation of mined peatlands in eastern Canada,"Many North American peatlands previously mined for horticultural peat have been abandoned recently, al- lowing natural recolonization to occur. The two dominant methods for peat extraction, hand block-cutting and vacuum- mining, have created distinctly different abandoned surfaces, leading to different recolonization patterns. Both types of exploitation can be found throughout eastern Canada where we conducted a vast survey of 26 abandoned mined peatlands in the provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick. The aim of this study is to describe the revegetation pat- terns and to assess the impact of local and regional variables as well as the time since abandonment on Sphagnum re- colonization. We inventoried the vegetation structure in all trenches (2571) and baulks (2595) of abandoned block-cut areas as well as in all vacuum fields (395) of the mechanically mined areas. We also conducted detailed species releves in 242 of these peat fields. In comparison to vacuum-mined peatlands, block-cut peatlands regenerated remarkably well. Approximately 80% of all baulks and trenches in block-cut peatlands had 50% or higher cover of ericaceous shrubs compared with only 16% found on vacuum fields. Herb cover in the three types of abandoned fields was similar to that in natural peatlands. However, Sphagnum percent cover was below 2% in baulks and vacuum fields and was 30% on average in the trenches, which is clearly below cover estimates in natural peatlands. Sphagnum cover and richness were both higher in trenches with thin residual peat deposit, and Sphagnum richness increased with latitude. Our sur- veys revealed that abandoned mined peatlands have a high diversity of peatland vascular plants species and a low di- versity of non-peatland species.",,,Sphagnum; Tracheobionta; MinEd; Peat; Spontaneous order; Estimated,,1/5/2005,,0,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,appendix,article,no,NA,Map,"c. 15 mosses, c.20 lichens, c.70 other plant species",1994-1997,source publication text,3,no,10000,no,abundance,,,,Canadian Journal of Botany,,,frequency data

After species description in 1835, it was first collected in the Izu Islands in 1877, with breeding first noted in 1901. Over the 20th century, murrelets were found breeding at 11 islands (i. e., Udonejima, Niijima, Shikinejima, Hanshima, Kozushima, Onbasejima, Tadanaejima, Sanbondake, Motone, Kojine, and Torishima) and were not thought to breed at 7 islands (i. e., Oshima, Toshima, Jinaijima, Miyakejima, Mikurajima, Hachijojima, and Hachijokojima). Surveys have not been conducted at 7 islands (i. e., Zenisu, Inanbajima, Aogashima, Beyoneizu-Retsugan, Myojinsho, Sumisujima, and Sofugan). The population is centered in the northern Izu Islands between Udonejima and Sanbondake. Once considered the world stronghold for the species, a large population decline apparently occurred in the mid-late 20th century: a) breeding no longer occurs at Shikinejima and Kozushima; b)some breeding habitat has been lost at Sanbondake; c)large numbers of nests reported by egg harvesters at Udonejima, Hanshima, and Sanbondake in early century no longer occur; and d)murrelets were observed less frequently on ferry trips between Oshima and Niijima in 1990-95 than in 1983-89. Current breeding population size appears to range between 350-850 breeding pairs(~7-43% of the global population estimated between 4,000-10,000 birds or 2,0005,000 pairs). Major colonies occur at Tadanaejima (100-300 pairs), Onbasejima (75-150 pairs),and Sanbondake(75-100 pairs), plus 20-30 pairs at Kojine.

The low blood cortisol levels in fish exposed to BKME were correlated to cellular atrophy within the hypothalamo-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis.

https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00044848,Succession in the southern part of the Canadian boreal forest,"Forest succession following fire in a forest mosaic of northwestern Quebec has been studied in order to: (1) describe the successional pathways using communities of different ages and (2) evaluate convergence of successional pathways and possible effect of fire suppression on the establishment of steady-state communities. As a first step, ordination and classification techniques were used in order to remove changes in forest composition which are related to abiotic conditions. Then, ordinations based on tree diameter distributions were used to study shifts in species composition in relation to time since the last fire. Even under similar abiotic conditions, successional pathways are numerous. However, regardless of forest composition after fire, most stands show convergence toward dominance of Thuja occidentalis and Picea mariana on xeric sites and dominance of Abies balsamea and Thuja occidentalis on more mesic sites. Stable communities of >300 yr occur on xeric sites while on mesic sites directional succession still occurs after 224 yr. Nearly all species involved in succession are present in the first 50 yr following fire. Only Abies balsamea and Thuja occidentalis increase significantly in frequency during succession. Following initial establishment, successional processes can generally be explained by species longevity and shade tolerance. Early successional species may be abundant in the canopy for more than 200 yr while the rapid decrease of Picea glauca, a late successional species could be related to spruce budworm outbreaks. Considering the short fire rotation observed (about 150 yr), a steady-state forest is unlikely to occur under natural conditions, though it may be possible if fire is controlled.",,,Command & Conquer:Yuri's Revenge; Succession; Immune Tolerance; Abies; Community; Picea; Zero suppression; Steady state; Diameter (qualifier value); Thuja; Greater Than; Motorola Canopy,,2004,,7,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,c.8 tree species,,,,,,,,,,,Vegetatio,1988,,

We tested Krecker's model (1939) which states that the abundance of invertebrates per unit macrophyte biomass varies with plant species and is higher on plants with finely dissected leaves than on plants with broad leaves. The abundance of invertebrates was measured in thirteen lacustrine macrophyte beds in southern Quebec, Canada. The model was tested for the total abundance of invertebrates and for the abundances of Chironomidae, Cladocera, Cyclopoida, Gastropoda, Hydracarina, Ostracoda and Trichoptera. 
 
 
 
2. More epiphytic invertebrates were found on the dissected Myriophyllum spp. than on the broad-leaved Potamogeton amplifolius Tuckerm, P. robbinsii Oakes and Vallisneria americana Michx. (P<0.01). More invertebrates were also found on P. amplifolius than on P. robbinsii or V. americana (P<0.01). The total abundance of invertebrates was not systematically related to the degree of plant dissection. 
 
 
 
3. The abundances of Chironomidae, Cladocera, Cyclopoida, Gastropoda, Hydracarina, Ostracoda and Trichoptera varied on different plant species (P<0.01). Contrary to Krecker's hypothesis, however, macrophytes with finely dissected leaves (Ceratophyllum demersum and Myriophyllum spp.) did not in general support more invertebrates per unit plant biomass than plants with large leaves (Potamogeton amplifolius, P. robbinsii and Vallisneria americana).",,,,,1/12/1988,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,article,article,geographic feature,NA,,c. 15 macrophyte species,1984,source publication text,<1,no,no,NA,presence-only,,,,Freshwater Biology,,,

https://doi.org/10.4296/cwrj2802301,The Development and Application of Multimetric Indices for the Assessment of Impacts to Fish Assemblages in Large Rivers: A Review of Current Science and Applications,"The biological assessment of lotic resources in much of the U.S. and Canada initially focused on wadeable rivers and streams. However, increased emphasis is being placed on larger, non-wadeable rivers. Many of these efforts include the development of multimetric indices represented by the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) following the original developmental work in the U.S. They include the pioneering work in the Wabash River of the Midwestern U.S., the inland rivers of Ohio and Wisconsin, the Ohio River mainstem, large western rivers and Quebec rivers, all of which focused on the fish assemblage. Monitoring fish assemblages in large rivers includes logistical and technical considerations that affect obtaining reliable estimates of relative abundance for all species that are amenable to efficient capture. A single gear approach is preferred for practical reasons and electrofishing is the sampling method of choice. Sampling effort is expressed in terms of distance sampled at a site and includes formulas based on fixed distances or multiples of river channel width. Relative abundance data are analyzed via multimetric indices (e.g., Index of Biotic Integrity), which are contingent on the development of a reference condition that supports a derivation and calibration process. Defining reference for large rivers represents a different challenge than with smaller, wadeable streams. For the latter, sufficient and suitable reference analogs usually exist, thus reference condition can be empirically derived. However, such analogs are either rare or do not adequately reflect the restorable potential for large rivers. Thus in developing the expectations that are necessary for metric calibration and IBI development, adequate historical knowledge of the assemblage is critical. Once developed, the metrics and indices provide meaningful measures of assemblage quality and response to chemical, physical, and biological influences and perturbations. This has been demonstrated for a wide variety of human impacts including water pollution, habitat and flow alterations, and land use changes. Successfully applying this protocol to large rivers involves taking the correct sequence of steps in the initial development of sampling and assessment methodologies. The IBI serves not only as an important benchmark of aquatic resource quality and condition, but also as a test of the significance of human impact on the aquatic environment. Developing and implementing a multimetric approach for large, coldwater rivers is feasible and would serve as a useful assessment and planning tool for determining the magnitude and severity of impacts from riverine flow and habitat modifications.",,,,,1/1/2003,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,other,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Calculation of indices

Others were transferred from l to 5 m from 5 to l m after initial colonization had occurred. Quantitative evaluations of diatom populations were made at weekly intervals. Results show that species composition, cell abundance and vertical stratification were dependent on depth and ultimately on light intensity. At all depths, newly immersed panels were mainly colonized by highly modle diatoms like Navicula spp. After six weeks of immersion, the Community from l m depth had developed into a distinctly two-layered algal mal. The upper stratum was characterized by filamentous (Melosira, Fragilaria) and branched tube-dwelling forms (Berkeleya), together with highly motile Nitzschia and Navicula. The lower stratum consisted of cells more closely associated with the substratum such √§s the slowly moving Cocconeis, erect fan-shaped Synedra and arborescent Gomphonema. After eight weeks of immersion, the uppermnost stratum peeled off and only the understory remained. In comparison with diatom colonies on panels directly exposed to sunlight, colonies on shaded panels from l m and unshaded panels from 5 m depths had a slower development, lower cell densities and were less stratified. Diatom assemblages observed on shaded ( I m ) and deeper water (less illuminated, 5 m) panels were very similar to the diatom layer intimately in contact with the substratum observed at l m depth. Species densities on panels transferred from l to 5 m and vice versa indicated that the dominance pattern was not related to differential Immigration but to growth (light) conditions. The vertical structure of the Community and diversity of growth forms were closely related to light availability. The effects of physical disturbarices on the dynamics of Community stratification are discussed in a model.",,,,,1983,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,De Gruyter,2009,,
https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3922,The effects of allospecific mitochondrial genome on the fitness of northern redbelly dace (Chrosomus eos),"Abstract Instantaneous mitochondrial introgression events allow the disentangling of the effects of hybridization from those of allospecific mtDNA. Such process frequently occurred in the fish Chrosomus eos, resulting in cybrid individuals composed of a C. eos nuclear genome but with a C. neogaeus mtDNA. This provides a valuable model to address the fundamental question: How well do introgressed individuals perform in their native environment? We infer where de novo production of cybrids occurred to discriminate native environments from those colonized by cybrids in 25 sites from two regions (West‚ÄêQc and East‚ÄêQc) in Quebec (Canada). We then compared the relative abundance of wild types and cybrids as a measure integrating both fitness and de novo production of cybrids. According to mtDNA variation, 12 introgression events are required to explain the diversity of cybrids. Five cybrid lineages could not be associated with in situ introgression events. This includes one haplotype carried by 93% of the cybrids expected to have colonized West‚ÄêQc. These cybrids also displayed a nearly complete allopatric distribution with wild types. We still inferred de novo production of cybrids at seven sites, that accounted for 70% of the cybrids in East‚ÄêQc. Wild‚Äêtype and cybrid individuals coexist in all East‚ÄêQc sites while cybrids were less abundant. Allopatry of cybrids restricted to the postglacial expansion suggests the existence of higher fitness for cybrids in specific conditions, allowing for the colonization of different environments and expanding the species‚Äô range. However, allospecific mtDNA does not provide a higher fitness to cybrids in their native environment compared to wild types, making the success of an introgressed lineage uncertain.",,,"DNA, Mitochondrial; Chrosomus eos x Chrosomus neogaeus; Mitochondrial Diseases; Crossbreeding; Inference; Dace",,19/2/2018,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,M,article,article,site coordinates,NA,Map,Chrosomus eos,no,NA,no,NA,25000,no,abundance,,,,Ecology and Evolution,,,
https://doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1005894525278,The effects of climate change on landscape diversity: an example in Ontario forests,"The predicted increase in climate warming will have profound impacts on forest ecosystems and landscapes in Canada because of increased temperature, and altered disturbance regimes. Climate change is predicted to be variable within Canada, and to cause considerable weather variability among years. Under a 2 √ó CO2 scenario, fire weather index (FWI) is predicted to rise over much of Ontario by 1.5 to 2 times. FWI may actually fall slightly, compared to current values, in central eastern Ontario (Abitibi), but for central-south Ontario it is expected to rise sharply by as much as 5 times current values. We predict that the combination of temperature rise and greater than average fire occurrence will result in a shrinkage of area covered by boreal forest towards the north and east; that some form of Great Lakes forest type will occupy most of central Ontario following the 5 C isotherm north; that pyrophilic species will become most common, especially jack pine and aspen; that patch sizes will initially decrease then expand resulting in considerable homogenization of forest landscapes; that there will be little 'old-growth' forest; and that landscape disequilibrium will be enhanced. If climate change occurs as rapidly as is predicted, then some species particularly those with heavy seeds may not be able to respond to the rapid changes and local extinctions are expected. Anthropogenically-altered species compositions in current forests, coupled with fire suppression over the past 50 years, may lead to forest landscapes that are different then were seen in the Holocene period, as described by paleoecological reconstructions. In particular, forests dominated by white pine in the south and black spruce in the middle north may not be common. Wildlife species that respond at the landscape level, i.e., those with body sizes >1 kg, will be most affected by changes in landscape structure. In particular we expect moose and caribou populations to decline significantly, while white-tailed deer will likely become abundant across Ontario and Quebec.",,,Spatial variability; Forests; Contour line; Picea; Moose (Perl); Zero suppression; Tail; Reindeer; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Population; Composition; Jack Device Component,,1/2/1998,,5,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ontario

Our study describes windthrow dynamics at a landscape scale of the Quebec North Shore region, Canada, and evaluates the effect of some site (soil surface material thickness or deposit thickness, drainage, slope, topography and wind), and stand (dominant species, height and density) characteristics on windthrow probabilities. The SIFORT database, created by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife of Quebec, the Quebec forest fire control agency and the Quebec forest pest and disease control agency, was used to perform a spatiotemporal analysis of windthrow, according to site and stand characteristics. Windthrow probabilities were influenced by topographic exposure (topex), slope classes and deposit thickness. Windthrow probabilities increased with topographic exposure. Windthrow occurrence was highest when deposit was thick (more than 1m) and slope class was medium (from 15 to 30 per cent). Finally, this study has shown the importance of partial windthrow at the landscape scale in the North Shore region. Thus our results suggest that from an ecosystem management perspective, clear-cutting must be partly replaced by partial cuts, in order to emulate the regional dynamics of partial windthrow.",,,,,1/4/2013,,7,semantic_scholar,,,,other,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,windthow
https://doi.org/10.4039/n04-055,"The effects of urbanization on ant assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) associated with the Molson Nature Reserve, Quebec","Abstract Urbanization causes the fragmentation of natural habitats into isolated patches surrounded by anthropogenic habitats. Fragment size and the intensity of human disturbance have been shown to affect both composition and diversity of arthropod communities, but most groups have been understudied. We investigated effects of urbanization on ant assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in and around the Molson Reserve, a preserved maple-beech forest surrounded by residential properties near Montr√©al, Quebec. We studied how local ant assemblages differed in terms of composition, abundance, and species richness, depending on whether they were situated in the interior forest, in adjacent residential backyards, or at the edge between these two habitats. We also compared an intact forest interior with a younger and moderately disturbed forest (‚Äúbuffer zone‚Äù) between the urban matrix and the interior forest. Few differences were detected between the buffer zone and the intact forest interior. Extrapolated estimates of species richness suggest that it is lowest in the forest interior and highest in urban zones. Community composition, as investigated with ordination analysis, revealed a clear difference between the fauna of urban sites and the fauna of edges and forest interiors, and analyzing the relative abundance of ants showed residential backyards to contain the most ants. Urban assemblages were characterized by several competitively dominant species, including one introduced or ‚Äútramp‚Äù species. The occurrence of aggressive and dominant species in urban sites and at the edges of the Molson Reserve could potentially interfere with the dispersal and immigration of ground-dwelling arthropods and negatively affect local diversity or community composition in isolated forest reserves in urban centres.

https://doi.org/10.1675/063.035.0403,The Importance of Agricultural Landscapes as Key Nesting Habitats for the American Black Duck in Maritime Canada,"Abstract. 
 Given historical patterns of decline, the American Black Duck (Anas rubripes) has long been a species of concern. To support the identification of core Maritime habitat, the distribution of breeding ducks was mapped at the landscape scale through the combination of GIS-based land cover information and five years of intensive aerial surveys (2006‚Äì2010). A predictive, mixed effects model was used to generate the maps, based on the weighted average of coefficients for the top 95% of all-possible models (as measured by AIC weights). The results of the averaged mixed model indicated that annual variation (YEAR), availability of surface water (WET_AREA, LAKE_AREA and WET_DIVERSITY) and occurrence of active agricultural landscapes (AG_PROP and ROAD_DENSITY) were strongly associated with the number of breeding pairs. The presence of larger numbers of breeding ducks in agricultural landscapes represents a departure from studies conducted in more intensively utilized regions (e.g. southern Ontario and Quebec), and suggest that the benefits of breeding in Maritime agricultural areas outweigh potential costs. Using 34,659 prediction points, duck distribution was modeled in relatively high and low years (2008 and 2006, respectively), resulting in detailed maps suitable for the identification of priority areas for habitat restoration and enhancement. In order to help refine conservation management plans, future work should more closely examine the impact of different types and combinations of Maritime agricultural production to better understand the way these landscapes attract breeding ducks.",,,,,1/12/2012,,5,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,BioOne,2012,,
https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1200279,"The importance of ecological constraints on the control of multi-species treeline dynamics in eastern Nunavik, Quebec.","UNLABELLED



PREMISE OF THE STUDY
Treelines are temperature-sensitive ecotones that should be able to expand in response to global warming; however, they are also controlled by ecological constraints. These constraints can create bottlenecks for tree regeneration, hindering treeline advances. Near Kangiqsualujjuaq (Nunavik, subarctic Qu√©bec), previous studies suggested successful recruitment of Larix laricina above the altitudinal treeline, while Picea mariana establishment remains scarce. We studied regeneration of both species to identify factors responsible for such contrasting responses. ‚Ä¢


METHODS
We measured seeds and wings to evaluate species dispersal potential. We compared seed viability and tolerance to shrub leachates with germination trials. To evaluate seedbed preferences, we compared seedling occurrence on the different seedbeds with seedbed relative abundance in the field. ‚Ä¢


KEY RESULTS
Seed germination was similar between L. laricina and P. mariana, whereas dispersal potential was higher for the latter. Germination of P. mariana seeds was more strongly inhibited by shrub leachates than were L. laricina seeds. In the field, we found only a few Picea seedlings, but numerous seedlings of Larix had established disproportionally on several seedbeds. While Betula glandulosa, mosses, and Vaccinium uliginosim impeded Larix establishment, numerous seedlings were found on lichens, mineral soil, and liverworts. The low occurrence of suitable seedbeds for Picea, mainly mineral soil, could explain the seedling scarcity of this species. ‚Ä¢


CONCLUSIONS
This study highlighted that allelopathy and unsuitable seedbeds could contribute to regeneration failure of P. mariana in eastern Nunavik and emphasizes the need to consider ecological preferences of species before predicting treeline expansion under a warmer climate.",,,Lichen - organism; Numerous; Plant seeds; Picea; Marchantiophyta; Germination; Allelopathy; Mosses; Natural regeneration; Betula Genus; Larix; Vaccinium; Seedlings,,1/10/2012,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,X,,,,,,5 tree spcies,,,,,,,,,,,American Journal of Botany,2012,,non-relevant information
,"The Odonata of Hamilton Marsh, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada","Specimen and sight records of Odonata from Hamilton Marsh, a small wetland on the east coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, are presented. Thirtythree species representing 14 genera and five families are listed. The biogeography of the fauna is discussed -the site lies at a crossroads of several faunal elements -and notes on behaviour, ecology, habitat structure and succession are included. Study area Hamilton Marsh (49o19‚Äô20‚ÄùN, 124o29‚Äô10‚ÄùW) is located 5 km south of Qualicum Beach, Vancouver Island, British Columbia (Figure 1). It is about 0.5 km wide and 3 km long. A small stream, locally known as Hamilton Creek, flows through the marsh and into French Creek, which empties into the Strait of Georgia. Hamilton Marsh is located in the Georgia Depression Ecoprovince (MEIDINGER & POJAR, 1991). Both peatland and mineral wetlands are common in this area of the province‚Äôs south coast (MACKENZIE & MORAN, 2004), but peatlands are rare in the Nanaimo Lowland Ecosection where Hamilton Marsh is located. The study site lies within the Moist Maritime Subzone of the Coastal Douglas-fir Biogeoclimatic Zone (COUSENS et al., 1996). This biogeoclimatic zone is restricted to low elevation (<150m) coastal areas in the rain shadow of the Vancouver Island Ranges. The climate is Mediterranean, characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Hamilton Marsh is a combination of several wetland habitats (Figure 2). COUSENS et al. (1996) described it as 20% shrub swamp; a band of Salix and Spiraea douglasii Hook. rings the wetland adjacent to the forest. Another 20% of the wetland is open water (<2 m deep) near the outlet. The plant community here is dominated by Nuphar lutea (L.) Sm., Brasenia schreberi Gmel. and Menyanthes trifoliata L. The remaining 60% is marsh, comprised of floating peat, root mats and associated plants; considerable open water occurs early in the year. Although the wetland is best classified overall as a marsh or marsh/shallow water complex, it has some fen characteristics -peat, aquatic mosses and other peatland plants are common. Several species of sedge form extensive beds along parts of the shore or extend into the marsh -Carex cusickii Mackenzie ex Piper & Beattie, C. interior Bailey, C. lanuginosa Michx., and C. sitchensis Prescott ex Bong. Other characteristic species are Comarum palustre (L.) Scop., Dulichium arundinaceum (L.) Britt. and Sphagnum squarrosum Crome. At the edge of the forest, Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud., Spiraea douglasii Hooker and Malus fusca (Raf.) Schneid. are common. The surrounding second growth forest is dominated by Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don, Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sargent, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco and Alnus rubra Bong. (CANNINGS, 2005). Two beaver dams at the outlets of the marsh account for its present high water mark of 88.75 m above sea level, recorded in 1995. This reading has not changed significantly since a 1981 survey. Low summer water levels range from 20 to 30 cm below the high water mark. This water level decline is the result of seepage, evaporation and annual irrigation use under a water license in effect since 1956. The total volume is estimated at 200,000 m; the volume below the high water mark is 170,000 m. During the summer, the declining water levels expose much of the dominant Menyanthes trifoliata and Carex spp. vegetation and may even expose the peat and root mat. Rapid succession is occurring; almost 100% of the marsh was open water in 1954, but only 20% or less of the area was open water in 1994 (COUSENS et al., 1996). From 1850 to 1950 much of the forest around the marsh was logged. Between 1940 and 1950, attempts were made to farm beaver and muskrat. To do this, established beaver dams were destroyed and ditches dug to further drain the wetland. After these efforts failed, the owner of the wetland tried to raise American Bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana Shaw) and Northern Leopard Frogs (Rana pipiens Schreber). To this day, a breeding population of bullfrogs remains. Collections and other data Many of the specimens from the marsh were collected by R.A. Cannings at various times and are housed in the Royal British Columbia Museum (RBCM) in Victoria, BC. Other significant collections were made by G.E. Hutchings and are in his collection in Victoria. The site was visited by participants in the 2000 Dragonfly Society of the America‚Äôs field meeting on 29 July 2000 (HUTCHINGS, 2000). However, the only intensive study on the Odonata is that of SIMAIKA (2005), which looked at the relationships among dragonflies and plants over a four-month period. Most of the records from the above collections are summarized in the present work, but the data are not intended to be comprehensive. In addition, some larvae and exuviae occur in these collections, but we have not analyzed these and do not report on them herein. Plant names follow DOUGLAS et al. (2001). Faunal elements Species may be grouped with others that share similar distributions to form what can be termed faunal elements. The following classification is modified from PORSILD (1958) and SCUDDER (1979) and is used in the annotated list below to indicate the ranges of individual species. Those elements relevant to the study area are: 1) Boreal -species occurring in the northern spruce (Picea) forests, across the boreal zone from treeline to the southern margin. In general, these species range from the Atlantic Provinces across the northern New England states, Quebec, northern Ontario, parts of the northern tier of mid-western states, the Prairie Provinces north of the Great Plains, and northern British Columbia, often ranging considerably southward in the higher mountains and plateaus of the western Cordillera. 2) Transition -species generally most common in the southern boreal forests and adjacent montane forests in the West and mixed and deciduous forests in the East. 3) Cordilleran -species confined to the western mountains and their intervening valleys and plateaus. 4) Pacific Coastal ‚Äì species confined to the lowlands of the Pacific Coast. 5) Western -species confined to west of the 100th meridian, but otherwise ranging widely in North America. 6) Austral -species transcontinental in the southern part of North America and, at the northern extremities of their ranges, entering Canada to varying degrees along the international boundary. 7) Widespread -species with broad distributions in North America, from north to south and east to west, overlapping several of the other elements listed. These species range into boreal regions to varying degrees. Annotated list of species LESTIDAE Lestes congener Hagen Faunal element: Widespread 18-VI (2004) to 9-X (1988). A few tenerals on 29-VII-2000; pairs in tandem 09-VIII (2004) to 14-VIII (2004); copulation from 9-VIII (2004) to 9-X (1988). On average, this is the latest Lestes to emerge in BC and the latest to fly in the autumn; emergence before early July is unusual and adults often fly well into November (CANNINGS, 2002). Lestes disjunctus Selys Faunal element: Widespread 29-VI (1981) to 25-VIII (1990); copulation from 12-VII (2004) to 25-VIII (1990); oviposition from 12-VII (2004) to 30-VIII (2004). L. disjunctus is the most common lestid at Hamilton Marsh. Pairs evidently oviposited on only Carex lanuginosa and Juncus arcticus. On C. lanuginosa they oviposited into fresh stems, low above the water surface; on J. arcticus, eggs were placed into dead tissue about 10cm from tip of stem. Lestes dryas Kirby Faunal element: Widespread (Holarctic) 18-VI (2004) to 21-VII (2004). This is the least common Lestes at Hamilton Marsh and the first one to emerge in the year. Lestes forcipatus Rambur Faunal element: Austral 18-V (2004) to 4-IX (2004); copulation from 28-VI (2004) to 16-VIII (1986); oviposition 12-VII (2004) to 14VIII (2004). Part of Simaika‚Äôs 2004 study (SIMAIKA, 2005) examined the sympatry of L. forcipatus and L. disjunctus. Patterns of pruinescence are the best characters for distinguishing males of these two similar species in the field (SIMAIKA & CANNINGS, 2004). Throughout most of BC, at least, male L. disjunctus has the top of abdominal segment 2 completely covered with pruinescence while that of L. forcipatus has the apical third bare. Because acetone damages these patterns on Lestes and other species, we recommend that the usual acetone treatment not be used on species with pruinescence. Unlike Lestes disjunctus, L. forcipatus prefers to oviposit in the living stems of Juncus arcticus. The species will also lay eggs in Carex lanuginosa and Menyanthes trifoliata. COENAGRIONIDAE Enallagma boreale Selys Faunal element: Boreal 18-V (2004) to 25-VIII (1990); in tandem 29-VII (2000); copulation from 18-V (2004) to 15-VIII (1986). E. boreale is the most common Enallagma at the site. Enallagma carunculatum Morse Faunal element: Austral 20-VII-1986. Enallagma cyathigerum (Charpentier) Faunal element: Boreal 21-VII (2004) to 18-VIII (1984); in tandem 21-VII (2004). Ischnura cervula Selys Faunal element: Cordilleran 18-V (2004) to 25-VIII (1990); in tandem 29-VII (2000). This is a common species at Hamilton Marsh, and one of the earliest odonates to appear in spring. Ischnura erratica Calvert Faunal element: Pacific Coastal 18-V (2004) to 15-VI (1996). This Ischnura is probably more abundant than the few collections suggest; flies early in the season and disappears before most visits were made to the marsh. Ischnura perparva Selys Faunal element: Western 18-V (2004) to 21-VIII (1990). The pruinose females, ovipositing alone, are much more conspicuous than the more delicate males. AESHNIDAE Aeshna canadensis Walker Faunal element: Transition 15-VI (1995) to 9-X (1988). A. canadensis is perhaps the most common Aeshna at Hamiliton Marsh in midsummer. Aeshna eremita Scudder Faunal element: Boreal 15-VI (1995). This Aeshna usually prefers lakeshores with less dense aquatic vegetation than occurs at Hamilton Marsh; the site is not typical of the",,,,,2006,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,British Columbia

The small wolf C. priscolatrans(= C. edwardii) of the early Irvingtonian seems unrelated to the modern red wolf (C. rufus), but gave rise to a lineage including the larger C. armbrusteri and culminating in C. dirus of the late Rancholabrean. A small wolf, possibly a descendant of the Eurasian C. mosbachensis, did not reappear in the east until near the end of the Rancholabrean. At the same time, the coyote (C. latrans) disappeared from the east, not to return until the small wolf was extirpated in the 20th century. Fragmentary remains of the small wolf, dating from around 10,000 and 2,000-200 ybp, show continuity with 14 complete, mostly modern, eastern skulls. Multivariate analysis indicates those 14 represent a well-defined species, C. rufus, distinct from large series of the western gray wolf (C. lupus) and coyote. There is no evidence that the red wolf originated as a hybrid of the latter two species, though early specimens from central Texas suggest it began to interbreed with C. latrans by about 1900. Three long-recognized red wolf subspecies appear valid: C. r. floridanus, Maine to Florida; C. r. gregoryi, south-central United States; and C. r. rufus, central and coastal Texas, southern Louisiana, and probably now represented in the captive/reintroduced populations. The subspecies C. lupus lycaon of southeastern Ontario and southern Quebec is statistically intermediate to C. rufus and western C. lupus, and may have resulted from natural hybridization of those two species. Such could explain how the red and gray wolf differ so sharply where their ranges meet in the west but morphologically approach one another in the east.",,,"Lupus Vulgaris; Lineage (evolution); Subspecies; Scott continuity; Coyotes; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Crossbreeding; Captive portal; Lakes of Wada; Specimen; Wolves; Large; Population",,1/6/2002,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,USA
https://doi.org/10.2307/2261594,The Relationship of Vegetation to Methane Emission and Hydrochemical Gradients in Northern Peatlands,"1 The bryophyte and vascular flora were described for a range of forested and open peatlands in the mid-boreal Clay Belt region of Canada, and in the subarctic region of the Labrador Trough, Quebec. The floristic patterns and their relationships to methane (CH4) emission, hydrology and water chemistry were analysed with classification (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). 2 Despite differences in vegetation physiognomy, chemistry, and geology, water chemistry (pH, Ca, Mg, Kcorr) and hydrology explain most of the species distribution in both peatland regions. In the Clay Belt, bryophytes respond primarily to water table position, and secondarily to water chemistry; the reverse is true for the vascular flora. The bryophyte and vascular ordinations are more similar to each other in the Labrador Trough than in boreal sites. 3 Although CH4 emissions are lower in subarctic than in boreal sites, mean CH4 flux is strongly correlated with mean water table position (r2 = 0.73) in both regions, but is not correlated with water chemistry. The highest CH4 emissions (seasonal mean > 100mg m-2 day-') occur in raised bog and patterned poor fen pools where the peat mat is degrading. 4 The relationships among CH4 flux, mean water table position, and species distribution are similar in both boreal and subarctic regions. Bryophytes are generally better predictors of CH4 flux than vascular plants, except for certain species in flooded sites (e.g. Carex spp.). Bryophytes are also better indicators of the long-term average position of the water table, reflecting relative zones of methane production and oxidation over the season. In the vascular plant analyses, shrub cover indicates dry conditions and low CH4 flux in the sharply differentiated string-flark-pool topography of the subarctic fens, but is less predictive of CH4 emission in the drier hummockhollow microtopography at boreal sites where shrubs and trees are more pervasive. Overall herbaceous or sedge cover is not indicative of CH4 flux in either region.",,,,,1/6/1995,,7,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,L,appendix,article,no,NA,"Map, site coordinates, administrative unit, geographic feature",c.20 plant species ,1992,source publication text,,no,no,NA,abundance,,,,Journal of Ecology,,,The only spatial information is a very large geographic extension (Labrador trough)

https://doi.org/10.2317/JKES100322.1,Tipula oleracea Linnaeus in West-Central California (Diptera: Tipulidae),"Occurrence of certain European species of crane flies of the genus Tipula on coastal North America has been known for a hundred years or more. A. H. Swinton (1909) reported a single female of Tipula oleracea Linnaeus from Cape Race, southeasternmost Newfoundland. But C.P. Alexander (1942) supposed it was more likely the very similar Tipula paludosa Meigen, which has been subsequently recorded from Newfoundland and nearby Nova Scotia. The most likely explanation for the occurrence of either species on the eastern coast of North America is that immature forms ‚Äì larvae and possibly eggs or pupae, for all occur in soil, near the surface ‚Äì were transported in soil used as ballast in European commercial vessels (Fox, 1952). The soil was abandoned on shores near harbors and replaced by cargo destined for Europe. How either T. paludosa or T. oleracea reached the western coast of North America probably involved similar transportation of immatures. The species have spread into interior eastern North America, and have recently been reported from Michigan (Gelhaus, 2005), interior New York (Peck et al., 2006), Ontario (Peck and Olmstead, 2009), and Quebec (Taschereau et al., 2009). There is no mention of either T. paludosa or T. oleracea in C. P. Alexander‚Äôs publications on the crane flies of Washington (1949) or Oregon (1954). In his section on Tipulidae, in the Catalog of the Diptera of America North of Mexico(Stone et al., 1965), he listed only T. paludosa and only from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. In his major work on the crane flies of California (1967:56), Alexander mentioned that T. paludosa had been found in British Columbia and seemed to be established there. He added ‚Äò‚ÄòThe species is of considerable economic importance and, unless the outbreak is controlled, may well be expected to spread southwards in the west, possibly to California.‚Äô‚Äô As Alexander predicted, T. paludosa has, in the years since 1967, been reported from near the coasts of both Washington and Oregon. Occasional specimens of both T. paludosa and T. oleracea have, in the past 20 years, been sent to GWB for identification. Recognition of these European immigrants has been facilitated by reference to the well illustrated work of E. N. Savchenko (1961), based in part on earlier works by B. Mannheims (1952) in Germany, and R. L. Coe (1950) in Britain. Commencing in 2002, co-author Arnaud (PHA) has sent numerous specimens of T. oleracea, among other Tipulidae, collected in the vicinity of San Francisco, California, to GWB for identification. As far as we are aware, these comprise the first major, long-term collections of that species from California. Umble and Rao (2004) recorded 27 specimens of T. oleracea from three counties in extreme northwestern California and mentioned that PHA had found the species in the vicinity of San Francisco Bay. San Francisco is approximately 270 miles (435 km) south of the collection sites in northwestern California. Using mainly his own modification of Malaise traps but also collecting off walls near lights, etc., PHA has collected T. oleracea throughout the years 2003‚Äì2009, in six counties of central, near-coastal California. The species is clearly established in that area and has become so common that numerous individuals have been captured in each of those years. So far, however, we have not heard of any reports of damage to grasslands in the area. In all, 1036 individuals (581 males, 450 females, 5 damaged) of T. oleracea were captured during this study. Collections were made in Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties, around the southern San Francisco Bay, Monterey Co., somewhat south of these, and Marin Co. to the northwest. More than one-third of the specimens were collected by PHA at and near his home in suburban South San Fransisco, San Mateo County. The species was taken in every month of the year, at one of these sites or another. There were no peaks of abundance suggesting the number of generations per year. Most of the flies, however, were collected in April through August. Dates for trap collections are not precise because traps were not checked daily. The crane flies were initially preserved in small, glassine envelopes.",,,,,26/10/2011,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,location,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,California
,Title : Discovery of Internal Standards for the Determination of Limonene in Sweet Orange ( Citus Sinensis ) Oil by Gas Chromatography,"Glasses doped with rare-earth ions are of interest materials in several hightechnological and environmental applications. Study of optical absorption near the fundamental absorption edge is a useful method for the investigation of optically-induced transitions, band structure and the optical band gap in glasses. We prepared bismuth borotellurite glasses doped with Sm3+ and Eu3+ ions by varying TeO2/ Bi2O3 content. By taking appropriate amounts of TeO2, Bi2O3, B2O3 and Sm2O3/ Eu2O3, glasses were prepared by melt quench technique. The raw materials were melted in a furnace around 900¬∞ C and the melt was quenched on a brass plate. The glasses thus produced were annealed to remove thermal strains by placing in a tubular furnace at 300¬∞ C for 3 hours. The glass samples were smoothed and polished using an Inland Swap Top Machine. Optical absorption measurements were carried out using a UV-VIS absorption spectrometer. Using Mott-Davis model, the optical band-gaps and the type of transitions near the fundamental absorption edge were determined from the absorption edge data which lies in the wavelength range 350 to 450 nm. The optical band gap of these glasses is found to remain constant with increase of TeO2 content and the absorption edge is mainly due to direct forbidden transition for Sm doped glasses and indirect allowed transition for Eu doped glasses. 36. Title: Detection Probability and Disturbance of Waterfowl During Aerial Surveys Principal presenter: Andrew Gilbert Major: Biology Faculty mentor: Dr. Christopher N. Jacques Abstract: Aerial waterfowl surveys have been conducted in the Illinois and Mississippi River floodplains since 1948. These traditional surveys provide an index of waterfowl population size and are used to track migration events, set harvest regulations, and for research purposes. New methods are being evaluated to estimate population size by randomizing survey locations and estimating count bias. We used double sampling to determine a correction factor for waterfowl estimates during fall aerial surveys. Immediately before an aerial survey, a ground observer surveyed waterfowl in predetermined locations from an elevated, unobstructed location where probability of detection was assumed to be 100%. Aerial counts were divided by ground counts for all common species and foraging guilds to determine count bias. Preliminary results indicate that mean detection rate for all waterfowl was 96.0% (SE=7%). Mean detection rate was 94.4% (SE=8%) for ducks, 105.2% (SE=11%) for dabbling ducks, 74.8% (SE=11%) for diving ducks, 53.3% (SE=8%) for mergansers, and 92.4% (SE=9%) for geese. Observers also documented disturbance to waterfowl caused by aerial surveys. Preliminary findings indicated 18.4% (SE=2%) of waterfowl, 12.2% (SE=2%) of ducks, 11.5% (SE=2%) of dabbling ducks, 4.5% (SE=1%) of diving ducks, 13.0% (SE=3%) of mergansers, and 28.6% (SE=4%) of geese exhibited negative responses (i.e., flew short distances, swam away, changed behavior significantly) to aerial surveys. Preliminary findings indicated that 5.5% (SE=2%) of waterfowl, 2.0% (SE=1%) of ducks, 1.2% (SE=1%) of dabbling ducks, 0.7% (SE=1%) of diving ducks, 4.3% (SE=1%) of mergansers, and 15.1% (SE=3%) of geese abandoned survey sites and did not return following aerial surveys. With our findings, traditional aerial surveys conducted in the Mississippi and Illinois River floodplains can be adjusted for count bias and compared with population estimates from randomized surveys to compare cost and time efficiency of aerial survey techniques. 37. Title: Prevalence of Ectoparasites and Strongyloides Robustus in Southern Flying Squirrels (Glaucomys Volans) in West-Central Illinois Principal presenter: Beth Scheihing Major: Biology Other presenters or co-authors: Will T. Rechkemmer, Sean E. Jenkins, Bridget M. Walker, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, Shelli A. Dubay, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, and Christopher N. Jacques Faculty mentor: Dr. Christopher N. Jacques Abstract: Parasites can have long-term negative fitness consequences for host organisms. The degree to which parasites may affect populations of host species may depend on a variety of factors including the host species itself and the ability of parasites to move between host organisms. Southern flying squirrels (SFS; Glaucomys volans) commonly occurs in all wooded habitats and has an eastern distribution south of the Great Lakes that extends up the east coast into southernmost Quebec. Nevertheless, a paucity of information on SFS parasitic diseases across Midwestern landscapes. Strongyloides robustus is an intestinal nematode that infects SFS and its congener (i.e., northern flying squirrel; G. sabrinus), though infection is more prevalent in the southern species, which commonly acts as a reservoir for infection. Infection with S. robustus also could be influenced by other parasites (e.g., ectoparasites) which could potentially increase susceptibility to S. robustus. Thus, the primary objectives of our study were to 1) determine prevalence and intensity of infection of SFS with S. robustus, and 2) determine the diversity of ectoparasites in SFS across west-central Illinois. Because of the unique landscape characteristics (e.g., high forest fragmentation) across the Midwest, population and disease dynamics of SFS may vary relative to other landscapes characterized by more contiguous forests. A total of 51 SFS were examined for ectoparasites, of which 25 (49%) were infected. Mean intensity was 4.12 ectoparasites per host. Preliminary results also indicate that 80% (n = 10) of SFS were infected with S. robustus. Our study is the first documentation of ectoparasites in SFS across Midwestern landscapes, which may assist with understanding ecological factors contributing to infection with S. robustus, and in turn assist with geographic prioritization of future SFS conservation efforts. 38. Title: The Examination of Time on Task Behaviors of Students with Disabilities in a Motor Clinic as a Result of the ExerciseBuddy Application Principal presenter: Lauren L. Brozman Major: Sport Management Faculty mentor: Dr. Cynthia Piletic Abstract: The Adapted Physical Activity Motor Clinic hosts students from the West Central Illinois Special Education Cooperative (WCISEC) on Friday mornings throughout each Fall and Spring Semester. The Adapted Physical Activity Motor Clinic has been an ongoing experience for Western Illinois students for approximately 16 years. The motor clinic is a learning environment for Physical Education teacher candidates, Communication and Speech Disorder graduate students, Special Education teacher candidates, and Education teacher candidates who are asked to educate and interact with students from the WCISEC. The WCISEC students range in age from 3 21 years . This learning experience gives Western Illinois students the unique opportunity to see development in the WCISEC students while also collaborating with other future professionals in an interdisciplinary/cross departmental experience. During the clinic time is divided between an on-land portion, where the students are active in the Brophy Hall gymnasium and swimming portion where students learn aquatic skills in the Brophy Hall swimming pool. The lessons plans are initially created by the physical education teacher candidates with professional input from the instructors of the kinesiology course and other future professionals working directly with the WCISEC students. The ExerciseBuddy application is used on an iPad to display a visual representation of the content that is verbally and physically being instructed by the physical education teacher candidates. For the purpose of the clinic Western Illinois students were encouraged to use the ExerciseBuddy application during their warm-up and throughout the lesson if it pertained to the objectives of the lesson plan. The application is an electronic visual board, that incorporates components of fitness training to communicate: expectations, repetitions, and body movements. The purpose of the study is to examine how the ExerciseBuddy application impacts the time on task of students with autism and intellectual disabilities. Data collection included recording the teaching sessions of the WCISEC students while participating in the gymnasium portion that focus on fundamental motor skills, sport skills, and lifelong leisure activities. Recordings of the students were collected while they participated in motor activities three consecutive semesters. The data collected observed groups of students (3-7 per group); individual student's performance with the application was not taken into account for the purpose of this study. Data analysis is completed by reviewing the digital recordings with a computer software systematic analysis tool known as SOFIT. SOFIT, was used to observe the recording once the semester(s) had concluded. The specific elements reported included: (a) level of physical activity, (b) session content, (c) instructor interaction and (d) instructor involvement. Significance of the research will impact the multiple professions, including physical educators, that come into contact and work with people with different types of disabilities and impairments. It is hypothesized that the results will indicate when using a smart tablet, paired with the visual component of Exercise Buddy it will aid in students' success towards meeting the objectives of the lesson 39.

https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi7090335,Towards Modelling Future Trends of Quebec's Boreal Birds' Species Distribution under Climate Change,"Adaptation to climate change requires prediction of its impacts, especially on ecosystems. In this work we simulated the change in bird species richness in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada, under climate change scenarios. To do so, we first analyzed which geographical and bioclimatic variables were the strongest predictors for the spatial distribution of the current resident bird species. Based on canonical redundancy analysis and analysis of variance, we found that annual temperature range, average temperature of the cold season, seasonality of precipitation, precipitation in the wettest season, elevation, and local percentage of wet area had the strongest influence on the species‚Äô distributions. We used these variables with Random Forests, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Maximum Entropy models to explain spatial variations in species abundance. Future species distributions were calculated by replacing present climatic variables with projections under different climate change pathways. Subsequently, maps of species richness change were produced. The results showed a northward expansion of areas of highest species richness towards the center of the province. Species are also likely to appear near James Bay and Ungava Bay, where rapid climate change is expected.",,,Map; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Random forest; Ecosystem; Seasonality,,22/8/2018,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,X,,,,,,c.30 bird species,,,,,,,,,,,International Journal of Geoinformation,2018,,"only a list of species provided, without spatial reference"

Tree-ring chronologies of the host species, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), were constructed to identify periods of severe defoliation and comparisons were made with tree-ring chronologies of nonhost species. In addition, the frequency of white and narrow rings was used to further confirm the occurrence of insect outbreaks at these latitudes. Some major outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony at the regional scale, but the initiation year, intensity, and extent of the outbreaks varied spatially. For example, the 1950s outbreaks were observed from 1951 to 1952 at 46¬∞N, from 1953 to 1954 at 47¬∞N, and from 1954 to 1956 at 48¬∞N.

,Using bird survey data to associate habitat type and bird species richness in a forest of southern Quebec,"Introduction The effects of habitat on biodiversity have been studied extensively. Species richness is a basic measure of diversity and can be a proxy for ecosystem health (Mitchell 2006). Birds are plentiful, diverse and identifiable to the trained ear, making them a useful umbrella or indicator taxa for biodiversity studies. Habitat largely determines breeding bird distribution as it dictates two fundamental needs: an acceptable nesting site and an ample food supply (Vickery and Arlettaz 2012). According to previous studies of bird species richness, a habitat‚Äôs structural diversity, or the number and varieties of nesting and feeding niches, is positively correlated to its avian species richness (Cody 1985).

,"VALIDATION TESTS OF AN AMPHIBIAN CALL COUNT SURVEY TECHNIQUE IN ONTARIO, CANADA","Amphibian call count surveys in Ontario use a common survey protocol. We evalu- ated the precision and accuracy of data collected by these methods. Multiple observers monitored the same routes to determine inter-observer variation. Inter-observer agreement in evaluation of calling intensity and occurrence was generally high, and the experience of the observer affected estimation of both calling intensity and the number of individuals calling. There was no significant increase in inter-observer agreement in evaluation of calling intensity or occurrence with 5-min versus 3-min surveys. Longer surveys rarely resulted in the identification of species not heard in the first 3 min. Surveys of 30-60 min duration indicated that return for effort declined sharply during the second minute of the survey, although new species were sometimes heard after as long as 15 min. Simultaneous intensive and extensive monitoring was performed on populations of Fow- ler's toads (Bufo fowleri) in southern Ontario and bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) in central Ontario to determine whether there was a relationship between calling intensity and chorus size or population size. We found a linear relationship between call counts and chorus size in both species. We conclude that the data generated with the call count surveys were adequately precise, but accuracy remains to be validated. Further investigation of the relationships among population size, chorus size, calling intensity, and environmental factors are required to determine whether extensive monitoring of calling amphibians can be used as an index of actual population size. However, until that time, we recommend that calling amphibian surveys be used as the first part of an integrated program using extensive monitoring to identify areas where populations may be declining, and intensive monitoring to confirm or refute reports of declines. EXTENSIVE monitoring programs using volunteer observers in conjunction with professional biologists are currently being used in Canada and the United States in an attempt to detect fluctuations and trends in both the abundance and distri- bution of amphibian populations using standardized techniques. Amphibian call count surveys have been implemented in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatche- wan, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Mich- igan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minne- sota, Missouri, and Iowa. The amphibian call count protocol used in Ontario is a point-count method that relies primarily upon the efforts of volunteer observers. Three-minute surveys are conducted along routes consisting of up to 10 permanently marked stations. Because of the difficulty of estimating distance in the dark, no at- tempt is made to limit the calls counted to a fixed distance around each survey point. Stations are set at intervals of at least 500 m to minimize the risk of counting indi- viduals more than once. Surveys begin 0.5 h after sunset and are completed no later than midnight. Each route is surveyed three times during the spring and early summer, with the dates of surveys depend- ing on the latitude of the route. Ontario has been divided into north, central, and south regions demarcated at the 43rd and 47th degrees of latitude. The three survey periods are 15 days in dura- tion and are set a minimum of 15 days apart. Participants are asked to survey dur- ing specific weather conditions. Minimum air temperatures for surveying are 8 C (first survey), 13 C (second survey), and 21 C (third survey).

Location: Bas-Saint-Laurent region, southeastern Qu√©bec, Canada. Methods: Data (species assemblages, abiotic and spatio-historical variables) were collected in 16 bogs ranging from 2 to 189 ha, and incorporated in a geographical information system. Major gradients in vegetation composition were identified using DCA. CCA was used to relate vegetation gradients to abiotic and spatio-historical variables. Results: A clear segregation of species assemblages was observed, from open and undisturbed bogs to forested and highly disturbed sites. Among abiotic factors, tree basal area, water table level and peat thickness had a significant influence on plant species composition. Among spatio-historical factors, disturbance level, area loss and fire were the most influential factors. Variance partitioning between these groups of factors suggests that spatio-historical factors had a major influence on peatlands, representing 22% of the variation observed in the plant species assemblages while abiotic factors represent only 17% of the variation. Conclusions: The results highlight the influence of agricultural and other anthropogenic activities on plant assemblages and suggest that even wetlands apparently resistant to disturbances, such as peatlands, can be severely affected by anthropogenic factors. Plant species assemblages of ombrotrophic peatlands of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region were, and still are, largely influenced by human activities. Nomenclature: Anderson et al.

After an outbreak of insect pests in 1996, a study of insect groups that may include potential pests or beneficial species was initiated. This article reports on the weevil diversity and abundance during three consecutive years of sampling (1997‚Äì1999) in two vineyards. All weevils were collected using pitfall and flight intercept traps. In total, 3,176 specimens were collected, representing 73 species in three families of Curculionoidea. The family Curculionidae was the most species rich, especially the subfamilies Ceutorhynchinae, Curculioninae, and Entiminae. Four of the species recorded are known to feed on the genus Vitis (Vitaceae) in North America: Madarellus undulatus (Say), Barypeithes pellucidus (Boheman), Otiorhynchus ovatus (L.), and Otiorhynchus sulcatus (F.). Of these, O. sulcatus is thought to represent the greatest potential threat based on adult abundance at one of the sites and the negative impact of this species in other wine-making regions in North America. Four species [Ceutorhynchus oregonensis Dietz, Pelenomus waltoni (Boheman), Rhinoncus perpendicularis (Reiche), and Sphenophorus minimus Hart] are recorded in Quebec for the first time.

For clarity on vector distribution, we sampled 481 ticks (12 species and 3 undetermined ticks) from 211 songbirds (42 species/subspecies) nationwide. Using PCR, 52 (29.5%) of 176 Ixodes ticks tested were positive for the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. Immature blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, collected from infested songbirds had a B. burgdorferi infection prevalence of 36% (larvae, 48%; nymphs, 31%). Notably, Ixodes affinis is reported in Canada for the first time and, similarly, Ixodes auritulus for the initial time in the Yukon. Firsts for bird-parasitizing ticks include I. scapularis in Quebec and Saskatchewan. We provide the first records of 3 tick species cofeeding on passerines (song sparrow, Swainson's thrush). New host records reveal I. scapularis on the blackpoll warbler and Nashville warbler. We furnish the following first Canadian reports of B. burgdorferi‚Äìpositive ticks: I. scapularis on chipping sparrow, house wren, indigo bunting; I. auritulus on Bewick's wren; and I. spinipalpis on a Bewick's wren and song sparrow. First records of B. burgdorferi‚Äìinfected ticks on songbirds include the following: the rabbit-associated tick, Ixodes dentatus, in western Canada; I. scapularis in Quebec, Saskatchewan, northern New Brunswick, northern Ontario; and Ixodes spinipalpis (collected in British Columbia). The presence of B. burgdorferi in Ixodes larvae suggests reservoir competency in 9 passerines (Bewick's wren, common yellowthroat, dark-eyed junco, Oregon junco, red-winged blackbird, song sparrow, Swainson's thrush, swamp sparrow, and white-throated sparrow). We report transstadial transmission (larva to nymph) of B. burgdorferi in I. auritulus. Data suggest a possible 4-tick, i.e., I. angustus, I. auritulus, I. pacificus, and I. spinipalpis, enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Our results suggest that songbirds infested with B. burgdorferi‚Äìinfected ticks have the potential to start new tick populations endemic for Lyme disease. Because songbirds disperse B. burgdorferi‚Äìinfected ticks outside their anticipated range, health-care providers are advised that people can contract Lyme disease locally without any history of travel.",,,Ticks; Indigofera; Oral candidiasis; Subspecies; Dimercaprol; Passeridae; Songbirds; Larva; Nymph; Borrelia burgdorferi,,1/3/2012,,6,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,cant access,,,,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,BioOne,2012,,

The most common habitats of weedy species (L. serriola, L. saligna and L. virosa) were along transport corridors, such as roadsides, road ditches, parking sites and petrol stations, grassy slopes and ruderal places. The most frequent species was L. serriola, an Old World introduction, which we observed in all states and provinces visited, except for New York, and in broad range of elevations (up to 2,358¬†m a.s.l.). Lactuca saligna was recorded only one time in Salinas, California. Lactuca virosa was found repeatedly in Washington State along the road to the Mt. St. Helens and in Redwoods, California. Native North American taxa (L. canadensis, L. floridana, L. ludoviciana) were recorded only in Iowa. Lactuca biennis was found only in Canada in the southern part of Quebec. Records of diseases and pests showed only occasional occurrences of downy mildew (Bremia lactucae) and powdery mildew (Golovinomyces cichoracearum). Most plant-disease findings were made in Canada. Results of these efforts enrich our knowledge of the distribution, ecogeography and ecobiology of Lactuca species occurring spontaneously in North America.

https://doi.org/10.1890/06-1056.1,Zooplankton biodiversity and lake trophic state: explanations invoking resource abundance and distribution.,"While empirical studies linking biodiversity to local environmental gradients have emphasized the importance of lake trophic status (related to primary productivity), theoretical studies have implicated resource spatial heterogeneity and resource relative ratios as mechanisms behind these biodiversity patterns. To test the feasibility of these mechanisms in natural aquatic systems, the biodiversity of crustacean zooplankton communities along gradients of total phosphorus (TP) as well as the vertical heterogeneity and relative abundance of their phytoplankton resources were assessed in 18 lakes in Quebec, Canada. Zooplankton community richness was regressed against TP, the spatial distribution of phytoplankton spectral groups, and the relative biomass of spectral groups. Since species richness does not adequately capture ecological function and life history of different taxa, features which are important for mechanistic theories, relationships between zooplankton functional diversity (FD) and resource conditions were examined. Zooplankton species richness showed the previously established tendency to a unimodal relationship with TP, but functional diversity declined linearly over the same gradient. Changes in zooplankton functional diversity could be attributed to changes in both the spatial distribution and type of phytoplankton resource. In the studied lakes, spatial heterogeneity of phytoplankton groups declined with TP, even while biomass of all groups increased. Zooplankton functional diversity was positively related to increased heterogeneity in cyanobacteria spatial distribution. However, a smaller amount of variation in functional diversity was also positively related to the ratio of biomass in diatoms/chrysophytes to cyanobacteria. In all observed relationships, a greater variation of functional diversity than species richness measures was explained by measured factors, suggesting that functional measures of zooplankton communities will benefit ecological research attempting to identify mechanisms behind environmental gradients affecting diversity.",,,Community; Small; Diatoms; Cyanobacteria; Phytoplankton; explanation; Phosphorus; Zooplankton; Gradient; Subphylum Crustacea; Chrysophyta,,1/7/2007,,4,semantic_scholar,,,,NA,yes,No dataset,,,,NA,,zooplankton community,,,,,,,,,,,Ecology,2007,,they have data in Figshare repository but it is only code
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q573n5tdx,Priority effects will impede range shifts of temperate tree species into the boreal forest,"<p>†Temperate tree species are expected to expand their distribution into the boreal forest in response to climate change. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that many species will experience significant setbacks in capacity to migrate due to a series of unfavourable conditions impacting their recruitment success, and thus their ability to colonize new locations. We quantify the relative influence of a series of factors important for tree seedling recruitment at range margins: propagule dispersal, substrate favourability, and the influence of the local hetero-specific species canopy composition. We hypothesized that boreal trees are responsible for priority effects that influence the establishment of temperate tree species seedlings. To do so, we analyzed two recruitment stages (first-year seedlings and older seedlings) for seven tree species; Abies balsamea (ABBA), Acer rubrum (ACRU), Acer saccharum (ACSA), Betula papyrifera (BEPA), Betula alleghaniensis (BEAL), Populus tremuloides (POTR), and Fagus grandifolia (FAGR) commonly found within the temperate-boreal ecotone forests of northeastern North America. Overall, we found that boreal canopy trees influence the distribution of substrates, more specifically the occurrence of needle cover and decayed wood in recruitment plots. Interestingly, decayed wood was a poor substrate in almost all cases. This association between canopy and substrate led to highly unfavourable substrates that affected the seedling densities of all temperate tree species. In addition, we found that seedling dispersion was highly localized, where the mean dispersal distance of all trees occurred in close proximity of parent trees. Unfavourable substrates and limited MDD (mean dispersal distance) of trees due to resident boreal trees generate (strong) priority effects within the temperate-boreal ecotone. Together these conditions promise to cause significant lags in temperate tree species migration into the boreal forest in the future.</p>","<p>A grid of 20 m x 20 m quadrats were established at each site to map overstorey canopy trees. Each site varied in plot size, where the total area of mapped grids ranged from 200-320 m in width and 200-1000 m in plot length. All trees within the study grid had their coordinates mapped using Leica Flexline© TS06 and TCR805 Total Stations. Each tree with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ?10.0 cm was mapped, identified by species, given a health status (living, dead, declining, fallen) and its DBH (1.3 m) measured. In the late spring of 2015, four recruitment plots (1 m<sup>2</sup>) were established within each of the 20 x 20 m grids at a 5 x 5 m spacing (3,424 total recruitment plots across all three sites). Recruitment was measured as stem tallies by species over two years (2015 and 2016) for two recruitment stages: (i) first-year seedlings (referred to as stage 1 seedlings); identified by the presences of cotyledons, absence of terminal bud scars, suppleness of the stem, and number of leaves, (ii) older seedlings (referred to as stage 2 seedlings); which were not first year and were &lt;30.0 cm in height. We visually estimated the percent coverage (to the nearest 5%, total summing to 100%) of the recruitment plots by the following substrates: grass, leaf, needles, moss, decayed logs, solid logs, and bole cover from overstorey/sapling trees. In addition to the substrates, we also assessed the cover of deciduous plant cover (non-canopy tree species) within the recruitment plot.</p>

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.rm83s,Data from: Hybrid system increases efficiency of ballast water treatment,"1. Ballast water has been a principal pathway of nonindigenous species introduction to global ports for much of the 20th century. In an effort to reduce the scale of this pathway, and recognizing forthcoming global regulations that will supplant ballast water exchange (BWE) with ballast water treatment (BWT), we explore whether a combined hybrid treatment of BWE and chlorination (Cl) exceeds individual effects of either BWE or chlorination alone in reducing densities of bacteria, microplankton and macroplankton. 2. Five full-scale trials were conducted on an operational bulk carrier travelling between Canada and Brazil. 3. The hybrid treatment generally had the lowest final densities among all treatments for putative enterococci, Escherichia coli, and coliform bacteria, as well as microplankton and macroplankton, with the former two being synergistically lower than individual treatments alone. Microplankton abundance in the hybrid treatment was significantly but antagonistically reduced relative to individual treatments alone. Macroplankton final density was lowest in the hybrid treatment, though the interaction between treatments was not significant. 4. Synthesis and applications. In most cases the combined hybrid treatment of ballast water exchange (BWE) and chlorination reduced population densities of indicator organisms in ballast water below those proposed by the International Maritime Organization's D-2 performance standards. BWE alone was often ineffective at reducing bacterial and macroplankton densities. Even when performance standards are implemented globally, continued use of BWE could further reduce risk of invasions to freshwater ecosystems that receive ballast water from foreign sources by accentuating the decline in propagule pressure and enhancing demographic constraints for putative invaders.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Hybrid system increases efficiency of ballast water treatment<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Environmental and biological initial and final values collected on the study ""Hybrid system increases efficiency of ballast water treatment""</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Data Accessibility-Hybrid system increases efficiency of ballast water treatment.xlsx<br></div></div>",IMO-D2; coliform; Vibrio cholerae; Synergistic; ballast water treatment; additive; chlorine; alien species; nonindigenous; enterococci,BÈcancour; Canada; Saint Lawrence River; Port Alfred; Atlantic Ocean; Quebec; Brazil; Trois RiviËres; Saguenay River,2015-02-02,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12397,10,zenodo,,,0,non biological,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4v700,Data from: Phenotype-dependent selection underlies patterns of sorting across habitats: the case of stream-fishes,"Spatial and temporal heterogeneity within landscapes influences the distribution and phenotypic diversity of individuals both within and across populations. Phenotype-habitat correlations arise either through phenotypes within an environment altering through the process of natural selection or plasticity, or phenotypes remaining constant but individuals altering their distribution across environments. The mechanisms of non-random movement and phenotype-dependent habitat choice may account for associations within highly heterogeneous systems, such as streams, where local adaptation may be negated, plasticity too costly and movement is particularly important. Despite growing attention, however, few empirical tests have yet to be conducted. Here we provide a test of phenotype-dependent habitat choice and ask: 1) if individuals collected from a single habitat type continue to select original habitat; 2) if decisions are phenotype-dependent and functionally related to habitat requirements; and 3) if phenotypic-sorting continues despite increasing population density. To do so we both conducted experimental trials manipulating the density of four stream-fish species collected from either a single riffle or pool and developed a game-theoretical model exploring the influence of individuals' growth rate, sampling and competitive abilities as well as interference on distribution across two habitats as a function of density. Our experimental trials show individuals selecting original versus alternative habitats differed in their morphologies, that morphologies were functionally related to habitat-type swimming demands, and that phenotypic-sorting remained significant (although decreased) as density increased. According to our model this only occurs when phenotypes have contrasting habitat preferences and only one phenotype disperses (i.e. selects alternatives) in response to density pressures. This supports our explanation that empirical habitat selection was due to a combination of collecting a fraction of mobile individuals with different habitat preferences and the exclusion of individuals via scramble competition at increased densities. Phenotype-dependent habitat choice can thereby account for observed patterns of natural stream-fish distribution.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">DataJacobsonetal2017<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">This file contains the density level, trial, selected habitat, partial warp and length and size variables for each of the individuals and species tested within artificial stream experiments.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",Cottus bairdi; non-random dispersal; Rhinichthys atratulus; phenotypic-sorting; Etheostoma nigrum; Semotilus atromaculatus; stream-fishes,,2017-06-02,https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.04126,10,zenodo,,,0,non-field experiment,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.15dv41p1m,A basic community dynamics experiment: Disentangling deterministic and stochastic processes in structuring ecological communities,"<p>Community dynamics are governed by two opposed processes: species sorting, which produces deterministic dynamics leading to an equilibrium state, and ecological drift, which produces stochastic dynamics. Despite a great deal of theoretical and empirical work aiming to demonstrate the predominance of one or the other of these processes, the importance of drift in structuring communities and maintaining species diversity remains contested. Here we present the results of a basic community dynamics experiment using floating aquatic plants, designed to measure the relative contributions of species sorting and ecological drift to community change over about a dozen generations. We found that species sorting became overwhelmingly dominant as the experiment progressed, and directed communities towards a stable equilibrium state maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection. The dynamics of any particular species depended on how far its initial frequency was from its equilibrium frequency, however, and consequently the balance of sorting and drift varied among species.</p>","<p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Source community</span></p>
<p>The source plant community was isolated from a eutrophic pond adjacent to fallowed agricultural fields on the Macdonald campus of McGill University, Quebec, Canada (45∞ 42' N, 73∞ 94' W). The pond sustains a diverse community of floating macrophytes, the four most abundant being <em>Lemna</em> <em>minor</em> (Lm), <em>Lemna</em> <em>trisulca</em> (Lt), <em>Spirodela</em> <em>polyrhiza</em> (Sp) and <em>Wolffia</em> <em>columbiana</em> (Wc), all in the family Lemnaceae. Large samples consisting of hundreds of thousands of individuals were taken in June 2020 and manually separated into the constituent species.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Experimental design</span></p>
<p>The experiment was conducted at the LEAP (Large Experimental Array of Ponds) facility at† Gault Nature Reserve of McGill University in Quebec, Canada (45∞ 32' N, 73∞ 08' W), (FugËre et al. 2020) (Fig. 1). 48 large mesocosms (surface area=2.43m<sup>2</sup>) were filled each with 500L of water piped from Lac Hertel, a mesotrophic lake on the reserve, 1km upstream of the experiment. The water was sieved to remove fish, tadpoles, macroinvertebrates, and macrophytes, but contained intact communities of zooplankton and phytoplankton. The removal of these larger organisms was to decrease unwanted variation due to sampling. Material from the source community was used to assemble <span lang=""EN-US"">four community types defined by the initial relative abundance of each species (10%, 20%, 30% or 40%) (Table 1)</span>. <span lang=""EN-US"">Relative abundance was calculated as mass-weighted frequencies using an average value of individual mass for each species. Each community was seeded with a total of 1g wet mass of community biomass, which works out to between ~2,000ñ3,000 individuals, depending on the community type (Table 1). Abundances of the larger species were determined by manual counting, while Wc, only ~0.5mm wide, was weighed and added in bulk, using an estimate of mean frond mass. Initial community densities translated to roughly 5ñ10% surface cover. †Communities were mixed after inoculation to remove any initial spatial variation. †Each of the four community types was replicated in 12 mesocosms (total number of mesocosms = 48) which were arranged in six blocks of eight mesocosms, each block containing two replicates of each community type, with community type randomized within block. </span>All mesocosms received a one-time initial addition of inorganic Nitrogen and Phosphorus (KNO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>KPO<sub>4</sub>), to obtain initial dissolved concentrations of these nutrients in the mesocosms comparable to those of the pond from which the source community was taken (800 µgL-1 N and 40 µgL-1 P).† The mesocosms were covered with 70% shade cloth to mimic canopy cover. Although this minimized the input of wind-carried debris like leaf litter, rainwater could pass through the mesh cloth, which roughly balanced water lost due to evaporation. Communities were then left to grow for 12 weeks, from the beginning of July to the end of September, ending shortly before the first frost. <span lang=""EN-US"">All mesocosms were randomly sampled every two weeks to estimate species relative abundances. This was done by first mixing the communities to break up species clustering </span><span lang=""EN-US"">(Hart et al. 2019, Jewell and Bell 2022)</span><span lang=""EN-US"">, then removing a fixed percentage of the surface area (~5%) with a net.

<p><span style=""text-decoration:underline;"">Statistical analysis</span></p>
<p>The main goal of this experiment was to estimate the contributions of species sorting, ecological drift, and initial state to community change. Overall variation in final species composition among communities can be broken into these three components, whose contributions to variation can be partitioned using an Anova framework (Travisano et al. 1995, Bell 2013). If Y<sub>ij</sub> is the final frequency of the focal species in community type i and replicate j, then its deviation from that species' mean initial frequency, Y<sub>initial</sub>, can be partitioned into three additive components representing the three sources of variation:</p>
<p align=""center"">Y<sub>ij</sub>† - Y<sub>initial</sub> = (Y<sub>ij</sub> - Y<sub>i</sub>) + (Y<sub>i</sub> - Y) + (Y - Y<sub>initial</sub>) †</p>
<p>where Y<sub>i</sub> is the mean final frequency of the focal species in community type i, and Y is the grand mean final frequency of the focal species across all community types and replicates. For n community types (communities with different initial species composition) each replicated m times, the total variation attributable to sorting, drift and initial state can be calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>nm S (Y - Y<sub>initial</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, the shift in grand mean representing an overall convergence to an equilibrium composition (sorting),</li>
<li>m S (Y<sub>i</sub> - Y)<sup>2</sup>, the variance among community types around the grand mean representing the influence of a community's initial state, and</li>
<li>S S (Y<sub>ij</sub> - Y<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, the variance among replicates of same community type representing neutral variation (drift).</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a partition was done for each species at the end of the experiment to estimate the overall contributions of sorting, drift and initial state, as well as for each intermediate census to assess how the contributions changed over time.</p>
<p>We calculated a normalized value of the change in relative abundance of each species at each census in each mesocosm as the difference between the relative abundance of that species in the current and immediately preceding census, divided by its relative abundance in the preceding census. For each species, we used the regression of this normalized change in relative abundance on its preceding relative abundance to determine whether species dynamics were frequency-dependent. We used the X-intercept (at which change in relative abundance is zero) as an estimate of the equilibrium abundance of that species in a stable community.</p>",<p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: CGSD2 ? 534217 ? 2019</p><p>Funding provided by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038<br>Award Number: RGPIN?2018?03846</p>,,,2022-12-26,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9568,10,zenodo,,,0,NA,yes,L,NA,NA,NA,site coordinates,site coordinates,"Lemna minor, Lemna trisulca, Spirodela polyrhiza,Wolffia columbiana",no,NA,<1,NA,0.5,NA,presence only,,,,Ecology and Evolution,,,dataset not useful because its a non-field experiment.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.931zcrjg3,"The role of fine?root mass, specific root length and lifespan in tree performance: a whole?tree exploration","1.	The root economics spectrum (RES) hypothesis predicts that fast-growing tree species have short-lived roots with high specific root length (SRL) to allow rapid resource uptake, and opposite trait expressions for slow-growing species. Yet, the mixed support for this hypothesis suggests that trees can adopt alternative strategies to increase resource uptake, besides an increase in SRL.
2.	We combined a novel mechanistic whole-tree model and empirical fine-root data of ten tree species to test the effects of one of these alternative strategies, notably increasing fine-root mass, on the tree's net C gain (used here as a proxy for tree performance), and to assess how fine-root lifespan influences the relative importance of SRL and fine-root mass for the C balance of trees.
3.	Our results indicate that accounting for the short lifespan of high-SRL roots has important implications for explaining tree performance and the role of roots herein. Without considering their faster turnover, high-SRL roots and low fine-root mass resulted in the highest performance as predicted from the RES. Yet, when their higher turnover rates were accounted for, a high fine-root mass and low SRL lead to the highest performance. Both our model outcomes and field data further show a negative relationship between SRL and fine-root mass through which species aim to realise a similar root length density. This trade-off further indicates how high a SRL and low fine-root mass as well as opposite trait values can both lead to a positive C balance in a similar environment.
4.	Our study may explain why high-SRL roots do not necessarily lead to the fastest tree growth as often hypothesised and demonstrates the importance of fine-root mass in combination with fine-root lifespan for explaining interspecific differences in tree performance. More generally, our work demonstrates the value of identifying and investigating different belowground strategies across species from a whole-plant modelling perspective, and identifies the relationship between SRL, fine-root biomass and lifespan as an important functional dimension to variation in species' performance.","<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Fine-root data were collected from ten temperate broadleaved tree species (Table 1) growing in a common garden forest at the Hollandse Hout, the Netherlands (52∞28'N, 5∞26'E), established in the 1960s and 1970s. The forest is subjected to a temperate marine climate with mild winters and summers and an annual rainfall of approximately 800 mm (KNMI, 2009).

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.51c59zw6x,Data From: Evaluating the correlation between genome-wide diversity and the release of plastic phenotypic variation in experimental translocations to novel natural environments,"<p>Phenotypic reaction norms are often shaped and constrained by selection and are important for allowing organisms to respond to environmental change. However, selection cannot constrain reaction norms for environmental conditions that populations have not experienced. This may allow cryptic neutral genetic variation for the reaction norm to accumulate such that a release of phenotypic variation occurs when it is exposed to novel conditions. Most genomic diversity behaves as if functionally neutral. Genome-wide diversity metrics may therefore correlate with levels of cryptic genetic variation and, as a result, could exhibit a positive relationship with a release of phenotypic variation in novel environments. To test this hypothesis, we conducted translocations of juvenile brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) from 12 populations to novel uninhabited ponds that represented a gradient of environmental conditions. We assessed reaction norms for morphological traits (body size and four morphometric relative warps) across pond environmental gradients and evaluated the effect of genome-wide heterozygosity on phenotypic variability. All traits displayed plastic reaction norms. Overall, we found some evidence that a release of phenotypic variation consistent with cryptic genetic variation can occur in novel environmental conditions. However, the extent to which this release was correlated with average genome-wide diversity was limited to only one of five morphological traits examined. Our results suggest that the link between genomic diversity and the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation in reaction norms may be limited. Similarly, reaction norms were constrained for many of the morphological traits examined. Past conditions may have constrained reaction norms in the putatively novel environments despite significant deviations from contemporary source population habitat. Additionally, as a generalist colonizing species brook trout may exhibit plastic phenotypes across a wide range of environmental conditions.</p>","<p>Environmental data was collected from novel ponds Brook Trout were transplanted to.

Using a medium-density SNP array, we documented genomic diversity and divergence at 2336 genetically mapped loci among three pairs of North American anadromous and freshwater Atlantic salmon populations. Our results show that across the genome, freshwater populations have lower diversity and a smaller proportion of private polymorphism relative to anadromous populations. Moreover, differentiation was more pronounced among freshwater than among anadromous populations at multiple spatial scales, suggesting a large effect of genetic drift in these isolated freshwater populations. Using nonhierarchical and hierarchical genome scans, we identified hundreds of markers spread across the genome that are potentially under divergent selection between anadromous and freshwater populations, but few outlier loci were repeatedly found in all three freshwaterñanadromous comparisons. Similarly, a sliding window analysis revealed numerous regions of high divergence that were nonparallel among the three comparisons. These last results show little evidence for the parallel evolution of alleles selected for in freshwater populations, but suggest nonparallel adaptive divergence at many loci of small effects distributed through the genome.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.292c8,Data from: Partitioning the effect of composition and diversity of tree communities on leaf litter decomposition and soil respiration,"The decomposition of plant material is an important ecosystem process influencing both carbon cycling and soil nutrient availability. Quantifying how plant diversity affects decomposition is thus crucial for predicting the effect of the global decline in plant diversity on ecosystem functioning. Plant diversity could affect the decomposition process both directly through the diversity of the litter, and/or indirectly through the diversity of the host plant community and its affect on the decomposition environment. Using a biodiversity experiment with trees in which both functional and taxonomic diversity were explicitly manipulated independently, we tested the effects of the functional diversity and identity of the living trees separately and in combination with the functional diversity and identity of the decomposing litter on rates of litter decomposition and soil respiration. Plant traits, predominantly leaf chemical and physical traits, were correlated with both litter decomposition and soil respiration rates. Surface litter decomposition, quantified by mass loss in litterbags, was best explained by abundance-weighted mean trait values of tree species from which the litter was assembled (functional identity). In contrast, soil respiration, which includes decomposition of dissolved organic carbon and root respiration, was best explained by the variance in trait values of the host trees (functional diversity). This research provides insight into the effect of loss of tree diversity in forests on soil processes.

However, we lack an understanding of how phenological responses to climate change vary among populations of the same species. Such variability has the potential to affect flowering synchrony among populations and hence the potential for gene flow.</p>

<p><b>Methods</b>: To test if an earlier start of the growing season affects the potential for gene flow among populations, we quantified the distributions of flowering times of two spring-flowering plants (<i>Trillium erectum</i> and <i>Erythronium americanum</i>) over six years along an elevation gradient. We developed a novel model-based metric of potential gene flow between pairs of populations to quantify the potential for pollen-mediated gene flow based on flowering phenology.</p>

<p><b>Results</b>: For both species investigated, earlier onset of spring led to greater separation of peak flowering dates across the elevation gradient. For <i>T. erectum</i>, but not <i>E. americanum</i>, this<i> </i>was also associated with a reduction in potential gene flow.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b>: Our study suggests that climate change could decrease gene flow via phenological separation among populations along climatic gradients. We also provide a novel method for quantifying potential pollen-mediated gene flow using data on flowering phenology, based on a quantitative, more biologically interpretable model than other available metrics.</p>","<p style=""text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt;"">Two elevational transects, approximately 800m apart, were established in 2013 on the east-facing slope of Mont St-Joseph within the park (see Lajoie and Vellend 2015).

Forest productivity may be determined not only by biodiversity but also by environmental factors and stand structure attributes. However, the relative importance of these factors in determining productivity is still controversial for subtropical forests.
2. Based on a large dataset from 600 permanent forest inventory plots across subtropical China, we examined the relationship between biodiversity and forest productivity and tested whether stand structural attributes (stand density in terms of trees per ha, age and tree size) and environmental factors (climate and site conditions) had larger effects on productivity. Furthermore, we quantified the relative importance of environmental factors, stand structure and diversity in determining forest productivity.
3. Diversity, together with stand structure and site conditions, regulated the variability in forest productivity. The relationship between diversity and forest productivity did not vary along environmental gradients. Stand density and age were more important modulators of forest productivity than diversity.
4. Synthesis. Diversity had significant and positive effects on productivity in species-rich subtropical forests, but the effects of stand density and age were also important.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.12b0h,Data from: Shade tolerance and the functional trait - demography relationship in temperate and boreal forests,"Despite being instrumental in forest ecology, the definition and nature of shade tolerance are complex and not beyond controversy. Moreover, the role it plays in the trait ñ demography relationship remains unclear.
Here, we hypothesize that shade tolerance can be achieved by alternative combinations of traits depending on the species' functional group (evergreen vs. deciduous species), and that its ability to explain the array of traits involved in demography will also vary between these two groups.
We used dimension reduction to identify the main trait spectra for 48 tree species, including 23 evergreens and 25 deciduous ñ dispersed across 21 genera and 13 families. We assessed the relationship between functional traits, shade tolerance and demographic performance at high and low light using structural equation modelling.
The dimensions found corresponded to the trait spectra previously observed in the literature and were significantly related to measures of demography. However, our results support the existence of a divergence between evergreen and deciduous species in the way shade tolerance relates to the demography of species along light gradients.
We show that shade tolerance can be attained through different combination of traits depending on the functional and geographical context, and thus its utilization as a predictor of forest dynamics and species coexistence requires previous knowledge on the role it plays in the demographic performance of the species under study.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Demography_LifeHistories<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Life histories values for each species and site, as obtained from the parameterization carried out in studies that used the model SORTIE.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1771t,Data from: Resampling method for applying density-dependent habitat selection theory to wildlife surveys,"Isodar theory can be used to evaluate fitness consequences of density-dependent habitat selection by animals. A typical habitat isodar is a regression curve plotting competitor densities in two adjacent habitats when individual fitness is equal. Despite the increasing use of habitat isodars, their application remains largely limited to areas composed of pairs of adjacent habitats that are defined a priori. We developed a resampling method that uses data from wildlife surveys to build isodars in heterogeneous landscapes without having to predefine habitat types. The method consists in randomly placing blocks over the survey area and dividing those blocks in two adjacent sub-blocks of the same size. Animal abundance is then estimated within the two sub-blocks. This process is done 100 times. Different functional forms of isodars can be investigated by relating animal abundance and differences in habitat features between sub-blocks. We applied this method to abundance data of raccoons and striped skunks, two of the main hosts of rabies virus in North America. Habitat selection by raccoons and striped skunks depended on both conspecific abundance and the difference in landscape composition and structure between sub-blocks. When conspecific abundance was low, raccoons and striped skunks favored areas with relatively high proportions of forests and anthropogenic features, respectively. Under high conspecific abundance, however, both species preferred areas with rather large corn-forest edge densities and corn field proportions. Based on random sampling techniques, we provide a robust method that is applicable to a broad range of species, including medium- to large-sized mammals with high mobility. The method is sufficiently flexible to incorporate multiple environmental covariates that can reflect key requirements of the focal species. We thus illustrate how isodar theory can be used with wildlife surveys to assess density-dependent habitat selection over large geographic extents.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Capture data of raccoons and striped skunks in MontÈrÈgie and Estrie regions<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Capture data of raccoons and striped skunks during wildlife surveys in MontÈrÈgie and Estrie regions, QuÈbec, Canada.

https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.00000005x,"Reproductive maturity in boreal trees, Northwest Territories, Canada","<p>In boreal North America, much of the landscape is covered by fire-adapted forests dominated by serotinous conifers. For these forests, reductions in fire return interval could limit reproductive success, owing to insufficient time for stands to reach reproductive maturity i.e., to initiate cone production. Improved understanding of the drivers of reproductive maturity can provide important information about the capacity of these forests to self-replace following fire. Here, we assessed the drivers of reproductive maturity in two dominant and widespread conifers, semi-serotinous black spruce and serotinous jack pine. Presence or absence of female cones were recorded in approximately 15,000 individuals within old and recently burned stands in two distinct ecozones of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. Our results show that reproductive maturity was triggered by a minimum tree size threshold rather than an age threshold, with trees reaching reproductive maturity at smaller sizes where environmental conditions were more stressful. The number of reproductive trees per plot increased with stem density, basal area, and at higher latitudes (colder locations). The harsh climatic conditions present at these higher latitudes, however, limited the recruitment of jack pine at the treeline ecotone. The number of reproductive black spruce trees increased with†deeper soils, whereas the number of reproductive jack pine trees increased where soils were shallower. We examined the reproductive efficiency i.e., the number of seedlings†recruited per reproductive tree, linking pre-fire reproductive maturity of recently burned stands and post-fire seedling recruitment (recorded up to 4 years after the fires) and†found that a reproductive jack pine can recruit on average three times more seedlings than a reproductive black spruce. We suggest that the higher reproductive efficiency of jack pine can explain the greater resilience of this species to wildfire compared with black spruce. Overall, these results help link life history characteristics such as reproductive maturity to variation in post-fire recruitment of dominant serotinous conifers.</p>","<p>Methodology is available in :</p>

Preliminary laboratory research has also shown a positive correlation between the concentration of species?specific eDNA particles and the density/biomass of a species in a given environment. However, the extent to which these results can be extended to natural environments has yet to be formally quantified. We collated data from experiments that examined the correlation between eDNA and two metrics of abundance (biomass and density) and, using mixed?effects meta?analysis, quantified the strength of that correlation across laboratory and natural environments. We found that eDNA particle concentration was more strongly correlated with abundance in laboratory environments compared to natural environments, accounting for approximately 82% and 57% of the observed variation in abundance, respectively. We found some evidence of potential publication bias that may have impacted the estimation of the correlation in natural environments; after smaller studies were removed from the dataset, eDNA particle concentration accounted for approximately 50% of the observed variation in abundance in natural environments. No effect of abundance metric was found on the strength of correlation between eDNA particle concentration and abundance.

The strong increase in several arctic geese populations, primarily due to changes in agricultural practices in temperate regions, can have severe direct impacts on tundra ecosystems through vegetation degradation. However, predator-mediated negative effects of goose overabundance on other tundra species can also be significant but are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that goose abundance negatively affects arctic-nesting shorebirds by increasing nest predation pressure. We used six years of data collected within and near a greater snow goose colony (Chen caerulescens atlantica) to evaluate the effect of geese on the spatial variation in (1) the occurrence of shorebird nest predators, (2) the nest predation risk (with artificial shorebird nests), and (3) the occurrence of nesting shorebirds. We found that the goose colony had a strong influence on the spatial distribution of nest predators and nesting shorebirds. Occurrence of predators decreased, while occurrence of nesting shorebirds increased with distance from the centroid of the colony. The strength of these effects was modulated by lemming density, the preferred prey for predators. Shorebird nest predation risk also decreased with distance from the colony. Overall, these results indicate that goose abundance negatively affects arctic-nesting shorebirds through shared predators.

Life-history theory predicts that individuals can increase fitness by producing multiple broods within a season. Despite the apparent increase in the number of offspring parents might produce per season, not all individuals are multibrooded, suggesting a trade-off. We studied ecological and behavioral factors influencing the initiation of second clutches in great tits (Parus major), an optionally multibrooded bird species, by distinguishing two types of clutches: replacement vs. true second clutches, produced after failure vs. successful first breeding attempts, respectively. We predicted that lay date, density, and investment in first clutches would decrease the probability of initiating a second clutch, but that faster exploring behavioral types with a faster pace-of-life would be more likely to be multibrooded. The probability of initiating true second clutches varied negatively within-individuals with lay date and breeding density. The initiation of replacement clutches instead varied negatively among-individuals with lay date and density, suggesting non-random settlement of behavioral types across environments. Individuals were less likely to be multibrooded when producing many offspring from their first clutch, suggesting within-year reproductive trade-offs, similar to previous studies. No previous research has linked personality to multibroodedness; here we show that neither the repeatable nor the plastic part of an individual's exploratory behavior predicted multibroodedness. We confirmed our prediction that the resolution of trade-offs may occur either at the within- or among-individual level.

Yet, in temperate forests, bottom-up forces often exert a strong influence on ecosystem functioning. Here, we report on the indirect influence of a pulsed resource, sugar maple (Acer saccharum) seed production, on nest survival in a migratory songbird. We hypothesized that seed production in year t would determine daily nest survival rate in year t + 1 through its effects on seed-eating rodents. We used the density of sugar maple seedlings (with cotyledons) in year t + 1 as a proxy for seed production in year t and predicted that it would be inversely related to songbird nest survival the same year. We estimated the density of sugar maple seedlings, eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) activity, and daily nest survival rate in the ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) over four successive years in a northern hardwood forest of New Brunswick, Canada. Seedling density varied by two orders of magnitude between years, whereas an index of chipmunk activity changed by an order of magnitude. Both variables were positively correlated and negatively correlated to daily nest survival rate. A logistic-exposure model including only seedling density received the greatest level of support (lowest AICc). Previous studies have reported the effect of sugar maple masting on seed-eating rodent populations, but the strong link we report between seedling density and songbird nest survival is novel. A nocturnal seed-eating nest predator, deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), was not considered in our models, which may explain why chipmunk was not the best predictor of daily nest survival rate. The trophic linkages we observed are remarkably strong for a temperate forest ecosystem and might become more prevalent in northeastern North America, at least on calcium-rich soils, with the loss of large-diameter beech trees as a result of beech bark disease.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Data from: Linking songbird nest predation to seedling density: sugar maple masting as a resource pulse in a forest food web<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Nest data were collected in four 25 ha plots from 2012 to 2015.

Yet, classic predatorñprey models assume spatially homogeneous interactions between predators and prey. We developed a spatially informed theory that predicts how habitat heterogeneity alters the landscape-scale distribution of mortality risk of prey from predation, and hence the nature of predator interactions in multiprey systems. The theoretical model is a spatially explicit, multiprey functional response in which species-specific advectionñdiffusion models account for the response of individual prey to habitat edges. The model demonstrates that distinct responses of alternative prey species can alter the consequences of conspecific aggregation, from increasing safety to increasing predation risk. Observations of threatened boreal caribou, moose and grey wolf interacting over 378 181 km2 of human-managed boreal forest support this principle. This empirically supported theory demonstrates how distinct responses of apparent competitors to landscape heterogeneity, including to human disturbances, can reverse density dependence in fitness correlates.",,"<div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Wolf data<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used to carry out habitat selection analysis of molves</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Wolf.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">Moose data<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used to carry out habitat selection analysis of moose</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name"">Moose.xlsx<br></div></div><div class=""o-metadata__file-usage-entry"">mortality_Caribou<div class=""o-metadata__file-description"">Data used to analyse the probability of mortality of 145 radio-collar caribou as a function of their distance from the nearest road of cut.</div><div class=""o-metadata__file-name""></div></div>",apparent competition; Caribou; Rangifer tarandus; Alces alces; Canis lupus; mortality risk,,2015-07-14,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2015.0973,10,zenodo,,,0,NA,yes,X,repository,.xlsx,NA,NA,NA,"wolf, moose",NA,no,no,NA,378181,"source link abstract, source publication text",presence only,,,,Proceedings of the Royal Society B,2015,,no spatial or temporal data (non-usable data)

Using a unique, long-term and replicated landscape experiment, we assessed the influence of a high density of white-tailed deer (</span><em><span>Odocoileus virginianus</span></em><span>) on the spatiotemporal dynamics of diversity, composition, and successional trajectories of understorey plant assemblages in recently logged boreal forests. This experiment provided a rare opportunity to test </span><span>whether deer herbivory represents a direct filter on plant communities or if it mainly acts to suppress dominant plants which, in turn, release other plant species from strong negative plant-plant interactions. These two hypotheses make different predictions about changes in community composition, alpha and beta diversity in different</span><span>†vegetation layers and at different spatial scales. Our results showed that deer had strong effects on plant community composition and successional trajectories, but the resulting impacts on plant alpha and beta diversity patterns were markedly scale-dependent in both time and space. Responses of tree and non-tree vegetation layers were strongly asymmetric. Deer acted both as a direct filter and as a suppressor of dominant plant species during early forest succession, but the magnitude of both processes was specific to tree and non-tree vegetation layers. Although our data supported the </span><span>ungulate-driven </span><span>homogenization hypothesis, </span><span>compositional shifts and changes of alpha diversity were poor predictors of beta diversity loss.</span><span> Our findings underscore the importance of long-term studies in revealing non-linear temporal community trends, and they challenge managers to prioritize particular community properties and scales of interest, given contrasting trends of composition, alpha, and beta diversity across spatial scales.</span></p>",,,Anticosti; vegetation composition; deer; plant diversity; large herbivores; forest succession; alpha diversity; beta diversity,,2022-04-18,,10,zenodo,,,0,NA,yes,M,repository,.xlsx,sites IDs,NA,geographical feature,97 plant species,1995,source publication text,<1,no,80,no,density,,,,Ecology,,,
